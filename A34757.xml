         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing the firſt Argument to a Holy Life: <hi>viz.</hi> That being God's Creatures we ought to be ſubject to God, as all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are; to obſerve the laws of our creation, and conſult the Honour and Dignity of our Natures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOraſmuch as thou knoweſt that thou art God's Creature, and did'ſt receive thy Being and life from him, and ſubſiſteſt altogether in him, thou muſt neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that thou art, and oughteſt to be at his diſpoſal, and to live, and act according to his intention, and the end for which thou waſt made. As thou art God's Creature, and haſt no other Being than what thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, ſo thou canſt have no power nor end, but what he who gave thee thy Being, giveth, and preſcribeth to thee. This is a law which all the Creatures of God are, and muſt neceſſarily be ſubject to, and thou ſeeſt that all the inferior Creatures doe act according to it: they doe employ themſelves, according to the capacity of their Being, in that for which God Created them, and tend directly to the end, for which they were Created, and ordained; and therefore,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48385:9"/>thou can'ſt not but know, that thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to do ſo likewiſe, and that, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever end thou waſt Created, thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to intend and proſecute the ſame in thy whole life. Couldeſt thou thy ſelf give life, and Being to any thing, thou wouldeſt and might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt juſtly expect the ſame from it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I muſt beſeech thee to conſider why and for what end God gave thee thy Being; for, That thou art indiſpenſably obliged to intend, and proſecute. Now thou art ſenſible, that thou haſt an excellent Being, and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, which thou beholdeſt in the World, are much inferior to thee. Thou haſt an Underſtanding, and by that the knowledge of things, which they have not, and cannot have, <hi>viz.</hi> of things Spiritual and Immaterial: Thou haſt a will free to chuſe, or refuſe, to do, or not to do, according to the direction of thy Underſtanding, without Coaction or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion; whereas they act neceſſarily, and without any ſuch liberty: thou haſt deſires implanted in thy Soul after things, which they have no apprehenſion of; and art capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſome enjoyments, which they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncapable of: to what end then, hadſt thou this excellent Being beſtowed upon thee, and what is it, that thou art to aim at, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and endeavour whileſt thou art in the world? Can'ſt thou think, when thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48385:10"/>thy own faculties, and capacities, that thou waſt made meerly to get a little mony, by carking and careing, by toyling and ſweating, by plotting and contriveing? a poor buſineſs ſurely for ſuch an excellent Creature to be employed about! and thou debaſeſt thy ſelf extreamly, and reproacheſt thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, if thou doſt imagine it. But Brother, thou knoweſt that mony is not a thing deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it ſelf, but for Uſe, as it procures neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the belly and the back, and things grateful, and pleaſing to ſenſual appetites and deſires; and therefore, thou muſt enquire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether thou waſt made only to eat and drink, and having made proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof: and I beſeech thee, brother, tell me, whether this will not ſink thee down into the condition of the beaſts, and birds, and reflect as injuriouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Maker; for certainly, they are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch gratifications, and ſatisfactions, as thou art, notwithſtanding thy excellent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and better capacities: they can feaſt as guſtfully upon thoſe proviſions that God hath made for them, as thou can'ſt do, and ſing as merrily. Thou doſt not Cloath thy ſervant in purple, and fine linnen, to ſend him to the plough: nor bring up thy child in all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite learning of the world, on purpoſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him in feeding hogs: and if thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48385:10"/>ſee thy neighbour act ſo fooliſhly, thou would'ſt not fail to deride him for it. And wilt thou dare to impute the like folly to the wiſe Creator, and Governor of the World, and believe that he hath given thee an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirit, to be imployed only about the Objects of Senſe, to the end that thou may'ſt live like the Beaſts that periſh? far be it from thee. Thou art made certainly for a much better, and nobler end than they were, and the conſideration of the powers, and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thy Soul, would lead thee to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, though God had given thee no other means of knowing it. Thou art capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of knowing thy Creator, of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating his infinite perfections, of admiring, and praiſing, and loving what thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Though thou liveſt in the world, yet thou can'ſt have thy mind in Heaven, and dwell with God by deſire and love; and whil'ſt thou doſt ſeaſt thy ſenſes upon theſe material and periſhing things, thou can'ſt feaſt thy Spirit much more upon the never failing wiſdom, and goodneſs of the Maker of all things. Thou knoweſt him to be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Good, and that every thing is good, and happy only ſo far as it partakes of his goodneſs, and felicity; and thou knoweſt that there can be no neerer, no other way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happineſs, than to give up thy ſelf wholly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48385:11"/>to him, to ſubmit to his goverment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to doe whatever he will have thee to do, to ſuffer all that he will lay upon thee, to have thine eye always upon him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thy ſelf in him, to deſire and hope more fully and perfectly to know him, and enjoy him. Theſe things thou knoweſt, or may'ſt know, and thou art capable of acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy knowledge: thou can'ſt give thy ſelf to God, thou can'ſt ſubmit thy ſelf to him, thou can'ſt ſerve him, and obey him with a chearful and active ſervice; thou can'ſt praiſe, and magnifie him, and relie altogether upon him, and hope and long for a compleat fruition of him. Behold then, what thou waſt made to do, and obſerve how thou art to imploy thy ſelf in the World. Here is thy end, and this is thy work, a work worthy of ſo excellent a Creature; it is called in one word, to ſerve God; and whatſoever thou do'ſt, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt to do, or beſtoweſt thy time in, that is contrary, or impertient to this end, is but vanity and folly, neer loſt labour, and will bring forth no fruit but grief and ſorrow, ſhame and confuſion; for that, it is not the work that we came into the world to do. We were made men, <hi>that is</hi> in the Image of God, not to live like beaſts, no, nor to pleaſe our ſelves in any way; but to ſerve, and pleaſe, and gloriſy God here, and to poſſeſs and enjoy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48385:11"/>him for ever hereafter. Judge then, good Brother, whether thou haſt not reaſon to ſerve God with all thy Might in a holy and Virtuous life.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Containing a ſecond argument to a Holy Life, from thoſe obligations which our profeſſion of Chriſtianity laies on us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOraſmuch as thou doſt profeſs thy ſelf a Chriſtian, I muſt deſire thee to conſider ſeriouſly, what the Chriſtianity is which thou doſt profeſs, and what the profeſſion of it doth oblige or bind thee to. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I beſeech thee to reflect upon thy Baptiſm, and to call to mind what was then tranſacted, and done between God and thy Soul, or (which is all one) between God and the Church in thy behalf. Now, in that Holy Ceremony thou waſt dedicated to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and, renouncing-the World the Fleſh and the Devil, did'ſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and vow obedience to all his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and God did mercifully accept of thy abrenuntiation, and dedication; and did take thee into his houſe and family, that family which Chriſt did purchaſe with his bloud, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48385:12"/>which he governs by his Spirit, and for which he hath prepared everlaſting bliſs, and Glory. Thou waſt then taken off that rotten, and corrupt Stock of the firſt and earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> which brings forth fruit only to Death, and Deſtruction, and grafted into the living Stock of the ſecond and Spiritual <hi>Adam,</hi> which fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies to everlaſting Glory, and Happineſs. Thou didſt renounce that Principle of Sin and Death, which thou didſt derive from thy firſt Parents, and whatever is grateful and pleaſing to it; and giving up thy ſelf to God, thou waſt received by him, and given to his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who took poſſeſſion of thee by his Spirit, which is a Principle of new life in thee. That all this is done in Baptiſm, not in Ceremony, and by way of repreſentation only, but in deed, and in real effect, is plain enough in the Scriptures. Thou may'ſt look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the following places for thy Satisfaction. Our Bleſſed Saviour tells us, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> Now, this Abiding in him, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe our Ingrafting into him: and this was done in our Baptiſm; for then, as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.13. <hi>v. We were baptized by one ſpirit into one body;</hi> and that Body <hi>is the body of Chriſt,</hi> as you will ſee <hi>v.</hi> 27. of the ſame Chapter. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48385:12"/>therefore, we are ſaid in Baptiſm <hi>to put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. v. 27. and in the <hi>6th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> we are ſaid <hi>to be planted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> by Baptiſm) <hi>in the likeneſs of Chriſt's death,</hi> v. <hi>5th.</hi> and by this the ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That we are ſaved,</hi> Titus 3. v. 5. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And, that we cannot (ordinarily) be ſaved without this Waſhing, and Renewing; our Bleſſed Saviour told <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John 3. v. 5. <hi>Except a man be regenerated of water, and the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Theſe places of Scripture being underſtood in that ſence, which the firſt and beſt Chriſtians did take them in, do teach us all that which I ſaid before concerning Baptiſm; and the Church, whereto we do belong, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them accordingly, doth teach us the ſame, both in the Office of Baptiſm, and the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, telling us, that in Baptiſm <hi>we are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,</hi> and <hi>made members of Chriſt, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors of</hi> (<hi>that is</hi> we have a Right thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit) <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Thou ſeeſt then (dear Brother) what thou art, as thou art a Chriſtian, and what thou profeſſeſt thy ſelf to be. Thou art ſeparated from the world, dedicated and conſecrated to God, united to Chriſt Jeſus, and in him and by him a Child of God, and an Heir of everlaſting Liſe. Thou
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48385:13"/>art not thy own (therefore) but God's, and thou art his, not only by Creation, but by Redemption and Purchaſe, by thy own act, and voluntary reſignation of thy ſelf to him, by Covenant and Promiſe, by a real incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into the Body of Chriſt, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his Spirit. This is an honourable and a happy Eſtate, and it was a wonderful Grace, that ſuch a worthleſs, rebellious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould ever be admitted into it. And need I now to tell thee (Brother) what kind of life, ſuch a man as thou art, and in ſuch an Eſtate ought to live? It is a rule in Nature, (thou knoweſt) that ſuch as a Being is, ſuch will be the actions and operations of it; and therefore, it is neceſſary that thy life and actions be agreeable to thy Being and ſtate, as thou art a Chriſtian; and ſince the eſtate of a Chriſtian is an Holy and Divine eſtate, it is neceſſary that thy life and actions be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Divine, as thy ſtate is. Art thou a Member of Chriſt, ingrafted into his Body, and quickned by his Spirit; and oughteſt thou not to be conformable to Chriſt, and to live the life of Chriſt? Art thou a Child of God, and oughteſt thou not <hi>to be led by the Spirit of God,</hi> [<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.] and to <hi>be a follower or imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1.) in Love and Purity? Art thou an heir of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (for all the Children of God are Heirs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48385:13"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.) and ought not <hi>thy Converſation to be in Heaven?</hi> Ought not thy Thoughts and Deſires to be upon thine inheritance; and thy Heart and Life to be ſuch as may render thee meet to be a partaker of it, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.12? Would'ſt not thou wonder to ſee the pleaſant Vine degenerate into a ſorry Thiſtle, and the fruitful Olive into an unprofitable Bramble? And what doſt thou leſs, if being a Chriſtian thou doſt live like a Heathen, if being in the Spirit thou doſt walk after the Fleſh, and mind the things of the Fleſh? Was it not a moſt dreadful Curſe that drove the great King <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> out of his ſtately Palace into the Fields, amongſt the Beaſts, to eat graſs like the oxen, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4? And doſt not thou make his Curſe to be thy own choice, when being a Child of God, an Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is more than to be Emperor of the whole Earth, thou doſt ſet thy heart upon this dunghil World, and haſt no eſteem or reliſh of Heavenly things? If with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Eſau,</hi> thou ſelleſt thy Birthright for a meſs of Pottage, and deſpiſing thy Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, deſireſt to have thy Portion only in this life? The reaſon of all this is plain enough, and I hope, will be readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by thee: But however, it is impoſſible but thou muſt confeſs, that thou art obliged to perform thy Promiſes, and to pay thy Vows
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48385:14"/>unto the moſt High; and that, ſince thou haſt given up thy ſelf to God, thou haſt not the leaſt power over thy ſelf, but oughteſt to live altogether to him. If thou haſt an ill opinion of thy Neighbour, and that juſtly, when he is not as good as his word to thee, how can'ſt thou but condemn thy ſelf, when thou breakeſt thy Vows unto the Lord? and if, when any Prophane thing has been offered to God, and conſecrated by Prayer, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and ſerves to Holy and Divine Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, thou eſteemeſt it as ſeparated from common Uſe, and calleſt it Sacrilege and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs to imploy it in common ways; art not thou thy ſelf guilty of the higheſt Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, when, being Dedicated and Conſecrated to God by Baptiſm, thou doſt withdraw thy ſelf from him, and never imployeſt thy ſelf for him, nor referreſt thy ſelf unto him? The Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>we are not our own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are bought with a price</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Blood of the Son of God) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. and I add to it, becauſe we have likewiſe given up our ſelves to him that bought us; and therefore, there is the greateſt reaſon that we ſhould <hi>gloriſie him in our Bodies, and our Spirits, which are God's.</hi> It was the Saying of a Devout Man, many years ago, <hi>'That it had been better for us never to have been, than to dwell in our ſelves and to our ſelves;</hi> and we ſhall find it too true
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48385:14"/>one day, if, forgetting our ſtate and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Obligation as we are Chriſtians, we do live to our ſelves, and not to God. But this leads to a third Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing a third Argument to a Holy Life, from the general Conſideration of a future Judgment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>COnſider, that there will a time come, when thou muſt give an exact account of thy life and actions; and it ſhall be known to all the world, how thou haſt demeaned thy ſelf, both as a Man, and Chriſtian. Dear Brother, believeſt thou the Scriptures? I know thou do'ſt, and thou haſt the greateſt reaſon in the world to do ſo. Obſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what they tell thee concerning that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which thou art to make; and then, conſider whether there be no reaſon enough, why thou ſhould'ſt be careful to lead a Virtuous and Holy Life. It is a mighty encouragement indeed to us in well doing, that our Saviour is to be our Judge; for he, who loved his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo as to die for them, will never forget the good works of thoſe whom he does <hi>call his friends,</hi> John 15.14. but leſt ny of us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48385:15"/>ſhould be ſo unwiſe as to make this an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a licentious and careleſs way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, promiſing our ſelves much favour from him, and an eaſie account at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he hath told us frequently, that he purpoſes to proceed ſeverely with us, and to ſhew no favour but what may conſiſt with the exacteſt Juſtice. And it well deſerves our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that, though he was the mildeſt, and mercifulleſt Perſon alive, and expreſſed the greateſt tenderneſs, and love to ſinful men that ever was, inſomuch that his Enemies caſt it as a reproach upon him, <hi>that he was a friend to Publicans and Sinners;</hi> yet he never ſpake of the Day of Judgment, but with great ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; nor of himſelf, as the Judg of the world, but in ſuch words as altogether exclude that fond partiality which wicked men expect from him at that day. Thus in one place he repreſents himſelf to be an auſtere and hard man, and tells us, <hi>That he expects to reap, where he did not ſow, and to gather where he did not ſtraw,</hi> i.e. He will expect, and require from us (when he comes to Judg us) an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of thoſe Talents which he hath entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with; and if we have not improved them to his advantage, he will <hi>firſt take them away from us,</hi> and <hi>then caſt us into a Priſon of darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth;</hi> Math. 25, 26, 27. and we may note
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48385:15"/>there, that it is with the <hi>unprofitable Servant,</hi> the Servant that brought him no Increaſe, that he will deal ſo ſeverely; and therefore, how rigorouſly may we believe he will deal with thoſe that do miſpend his Talents, and make no Uſe of them, but to his diſhonour? In the ſame Chapter likewiſe; we find him no leſs ſevere to five fooliſh Virgins, whom he ſhuts for ever out of Heaven, <hi>becauſe they had no oyl with their Lamps, and were not ready exactly at the hour (though it was midnight) to meet the Bridegroom,</hi> v. 12. In another place, he condemns to everlaſting miſery, not only thoſe who accept not his invitation to his Marriage-Feaſt, <hi>but thoſe likewiſe that came to it without wedding garments,</hi> Math. 22. v. 12, 13. and in the <hi>7th</hi> Chapter of the ſame Goſpel he declares, <hi>That this ſhall be the portion of all the workers of iniquity, though they have called him Lord, and propheſied in his Name, and caſt out Devils, and done many wonderful works;</hi> that is, though they have profeſſed themſelves his Diſciples, and Servants, and done ſome things, which the world accounts great, for his honour, yet he will not own them; and though they make fiar Pleas for themſelves, and beg his mercy, and favour, with the greateſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and importunity, yet he will have no regard unto them, but baniſh them for ever from him. All this, and much more than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48385:16"/>this, hath our Bleſſed Saviour told us by way of Parable; and he hath no where encouraged us to hope for any thing more eaſie and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when he ſpeaks plainly of it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Parable. He hath let us know in plain words, that he will judg our works, nay, our very words alſo, and require an account, not only of our filthy and ungodly Speeches, <hi>but of our idle, our vain and unprofitable diſcourſes likewiſe,</hi> Math. 12.36. v. Nay farther, he hath told us, That the <hi>very thoughts and purpoſes of our hearts ſhall be brought into Judgment; the offending eye, the lustful, adulterous eye may cauſe the whole body to be caſt into. hell; and that a cauſeleſs anger entertained againſt our brethren,</hi> though it ſhew it ſelf neither by words, nor deeds, <hi>will bring us into danger of Condemnation,</hi> Math. 5.22, 23. Thou wilt think theſe hard Sayings, it may be; and yet there is ſomewhat more to be conſidered, which may make thee think them much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Might our Judgment be in private, and our accounts be made between God, and our ſelves only, we might, perhaps, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that which hath been ſaid, look upon it as tolerable. But, alas! we are told, that it muſt be publick, (without any regard to our modeſty) and before all the world; that <hi>the very Secrets of our hearts ſhall be diſcloſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men and Angels; that the hidden things of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48385:16"/>darkneſs ſhall be brought to light</hi> (as one tels us who well knew the mind of Chriſt, 1. Cor. 4.5.) and <hi>all our counſels be made manifest.</hi> And further, that this ſhall be at <hi>a time when</hi> (perhaps) <hi>we did not look for it,</hi> at <hi>midnight</hi> or at <hi>Cocks-crowing;</hi> that we may be hurried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Chriſts Judgment-Seat, before we can trim our lamps, or make ready our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, or think what couſe to take to approve our ſelves to our Judg and Lord. <hi>We may be Eating and Drinking, or Buying and Selling, or Planting and Building (as the people were in the Old World when the Flood came and Swept them all away) and the Son of man ſhall be revealed from Heaven,</hi> and <hi>we ſhall be taken as in a Snare,</hi> we ſhall not be able to flee away from him, nor to ſtand before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not prepared and ready for him. See <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27, 28. Nay yet further, his Coming, we are told, will be with ſo much Majeſty and Glory, there ſhall ſo many dreadful things go before it, and ſo much terror accompany it, that, we ſhall be utterly confounded, and not able to lift up our Heads, if clear and good conſciences, and juſt and right accounts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and made ready before hand, do not give us ſome confidence and aſſurance before him: <hi>The Heaven ſhall paſs away with a great noyſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48385:17"/>heat, and the Earth and all the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. and then <hi>ſhall the Lord Jeſus deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the Trump of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. and all <hi>the Nations and kindreds of the Earth, and thoſe that are in their Graves ſhall hear his voice,</hi> John 5.28. and behold his Glory, the <hi>Glory of the King of Kings, and of the Lord of Lords; who treadeth the winepreſs of the fierceneſs, and wrath of Almighty God.</hi> Rev. 19.15, and 16. O dear Chriſtian Brother, what wilt thou do in that day? and what ſhall I do who now ask thee the Queſtion? how ſhall we be able to bear the ſight of ſo great Majeſty, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? how ſhall we have the courage to appear before it? what dread, what horror will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs our ſouls? what confuſion will cover our faces? how ſhall we tremble, when we think of our trial before that impartial and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bar? and how will our hearts ſink within us, when we are called to anſwer for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? O Brother, what will a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thinkeſt thou, be worth at that day? what wouldeſt thou then give for a pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted life, to preſent before the juſt Judg of Heaven and Earth? for as great a number of good works, as thou haſt of fins, and rebellions and provocations? whatever thou thinkeſt of a good life now, believe it, thou wilt then think
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48385:17"/>well of it; and happy, thrice happy, ſhalt thou be, if thy own heart condemn thee not of wickedneſs and impiety. Whether it will do ſo or not, I am not able to tell thee, but this I can aſſure thee, that no tongue is able to expreſs the Amazement, the Conſternation, the Horror, and Anguiſh, the Perplexity that ſhall poſſeſs and overwhelm thee, if it do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee. Thou wilt not know what courſe to take, which way to look, nor whether to betake thy ſelf; to avoid the Judgment will be impoſſible, and to bear it thou wilt not be able: if thou calleſt for mercy thou ſhalt find none; if thou deſireſt death, thy deſire will not be granted; if thou calleſt to the Hills to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, they ſhall be deaf unto thee; all hope, all confort ſhall utterly forſake thee, and thou muſt ſtand at the dreadful tribunal as a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and helpleſs wretch, till thou heareſt that dreadful and irrevocable ſentence, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil, and his Angels.</hi> And now Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tell me, I beſeech thee, what thoughts thou haſt of a Holy Life? is there any reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt be carefull to lead ſuch a life, or not? doſt thou think, that thou can'ſt avoid this dreadful account we have ſpoken of? or doſt thou hope, that an account made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that careleſs, and carnal way of living which we ſee moſt men live, will paſs at that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48385:18"/>juſt tribunal; and be accepted of as good? can'ſt thou have the face to make before God, and all the world, ſuch a declaration as this? God gave me an excellent Being, I acknowledg, and appointed me an excellent end; <q>but I neither conſidered the one, nor thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other: God made me capable to know him, to love him, and worſhip and ſerve him; and I was frequently told, that the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of my life was to do thus; but this I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended nor deſigned, or if I did, it was but by the by, and when I had nothing elſe to do: I cannot deny but I was capable of bringing my Maker a great Increaſe of Glory, by the Uſe and improvement of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faculties he beſtowed upon me; but the luſts and and appetites of the fleſh, and the pleaſures of providing for, and ſatisfying them, made me forget my ſelf and the honor of him that made me. I muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg likewiſe, that it was not ordinary Grace which called me to the knowledg of Chriſt, and that I thought my ſelf partaker of no little honor and advantage by it; but whether my Chriſtianity laid any other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations vpon me than the bearing the Name of a Chriſtian, I could never find time to conſider, nor think it worth while to enquire: I thought better of my ſelf indeed than of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, for my being a Chriſtian; but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48385:18"/>that I have lived better than they, that I have been more mindful of God, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to men, I am not able to ſay: I have talked much of Heaven, but I ever loved the World before it; and though I profeſſed great love to Chriſt, yet my main buſineſs has always been to pleaſe my ſelf.</q> I know thou wilt cry out upon this, as moſt abſurd and unreaſonable, and conclude it impoſſible any perſon ſhould find mercy at that great day, that can ſpeak nothing better for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and yet I defie all our Common care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chriſtians, to make any better plea for themſelves, or to give any account of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe talents that God hath intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with, which may be judged more tolerable, or more likely to be accepted. Haſt thou a ſon or ſervant, whom thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed great coſt upon, to fit him for doing thee ſome conſiderable, and important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and haſt thou committed it to his care and charge, given him a competent time, and furniſhed him with all neceſſaries and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites for the doing it; and that Son or Servant after his time expired returns to give thee ſuch an account as this? <q>Soe much of my time I ſpent in eating and drinking, in revelling and rioting, in ſinging and danceing, in courting and ſporting, about which all my thoughts and all my care were wholly taken
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48385:19"/>up; and as for the great buſineſs thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded'ſt me to do, I never thought upon it, or not till it was too late, when I had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, nor other requiſites remaining to effect it.</q> Would not ſuch a Son or Servant vex thee to the heart? and wouldeſt not thou think him worthy of the greateſt ſhame and puniſhment? Remember, Brother, that it will by thy own caſe, if neglecting the great end of thy Life and Being, and the indiſpenſible obligations of thy moſt Holy Religion, thou can'ſt only reckon at the great day thy getting of mony, or thy ſpending it to the ſatisfaction of thy beaſtly luſts and appetites. But this ſhall lead me to another Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>viz.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>COnſider the puniſhments which Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God hath prepared for thoſe unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, who will not be able to ſtand in that Judgment, but muſt fall under the dreadful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48385:19"/>ſentence of condemnation. And that thou may'ſt know how great thoſe puniſhments will be, thou wilt do well to call to mind what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments God hath often inflicted upon wicked men in this world. I moit the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Adams ſin and diſobedience, which the whole World ſtill labours under, as alſo the fruits of our own ſins, which perhaps we have more than once ſmarted for: let it be remembred how God deſtroyed all math and except eight perſons, with a floud of water, for their ſins, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. How he overthrew Five Cities with Fire and Brimſtone for their Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs and Impiety, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. How he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his own people, for whom he had wrought many wonders in the Wilderneſs, when they would not obey his voice, <hi>cauſing three and twenty thouſand of them to fall in one day,</hi> 1 Cor, 10. and 8. How he gave Commandment utterly to deſtroy the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites, and not to ſpare their ſucking children, for a ſin committed by their Fathers Four Hundred years before: and in a word, how he gave up his own once beloved people and their City and Country, to the moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ruine and deſolation that ever was; and how their poſterity are ſcattered to this day over the face of the whole earth, and hated of all people, bearing the ſin and curſe of their Forefathers. <hi>His bloud be upon us, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48385:20"/>our children,</hi> Math. 27.25. Theſe are great demonſtrations of Gods hatred againſt ſin, and from theſe we do learn, That thoſe Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are appointed for wicked men in another World, muſt needs be very griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſuch as will make them extreamly miſerable. For, as the Scriptures tell us, This is the time of Gods patience, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and goodneſs towards ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. and if in this time he ſhews ſo much ſeverity, how ſevere may we believe he will be, when this time of his goodneſs is ended, and when the day of his wrath, as the Scripture calls it, is come; that day of juſtice without mercy, of vengeance without pity, of execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further patience and forbearance: when all the wrath that wicked men have deſerved, and have treaſured up againſt themſſelves, ſhall fall upon their guilty Souls, and God ſhall as deſignedly magnify his impartial Juſtice in their torment and miſery, as he will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his mercy and goodneſs in the glory and felicity of his faithful Servants? But we have yet a better way of learning how great the puniſhments of the Damned ſhall be, and that is, by conſidering what the Scriptures have told us in plain words concerning them; they are ſuch puniſhments, our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tels us, as <hi>are prepared for the</hi> Devil <hi>and his Angels</hi> Math. 25. <hi>v.</hi> 41. that is, for the

They are puniſhments by fire, as he alſo tels us, which is the moſt rageing, the moſt devouring and Tormenting thing we know in the World: and that fire is repreſented to be ſuch as our Nature do's moſt abhor, and muſt needs be moſt inſufferable, <hi>viz. A Fire with Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> the Stench of which is as intolerable as the Heat, and which ſuffocates as well as conſumes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 8. of this Fire, we are told likewiſe, <hi>There is a Bottomleſs Lake or Pit.</hi> Rev. 20. <hi>v.</hi> 3. into which there ſhall never enter the leaſt Light, <hi>the very Blackneſs of Darkneſs,</hi> as <hi>St. Judes</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are, <hi>v.</hi> 17. lying upon it for ever.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48385:21"/>Shrieking of the Children frying in the fire in the Valley of Hinnom.</hi> 2 King. 23. <hi>v.</hi> 10. which the word uſed by our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for Hell, <hi>Math,</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. doth imply; and theſe Torments, and Wailings, and Heart-breaking Cries ſhall continue, not for a Moneth, or a Year, or an Age, but for ever and ever. <hi>The fire ſhall never be quenched,</hi> Mark 9. <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>the ſmoak of their Torment is ever to aſcend,</hi> Rev. 14. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. and they <hi>ſhall find no rest night nor day.</hi> This is a little, and but a little of what the Scripture tels us, of the puniſhments of the damned; but in this little there are ſo many dreadful things implyed, that he muſt be bold and hardned even to a wonder, that is not affrighted with them. for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is plain, that the puniſhments are ſuch as will Torment the whole Man, Body and Soul, with all their faculties and powers, and that in the Extreameſt manner. There ſhall not be a member of the Body, nor any faculty in the Soul, but ſhall have its Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one and the ſame inſtant, and that Torment ſhall be ſo great that no words can expreſs it, nor heart can conceive it. How can it be otherwiſe, doſt thou think, in a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone? what Member of the Body will not be ſcorched? what ſenſe will not be afflicted? what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48385:21"/>will not be Tormented? The laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eyes will be plagued with darkneſs, and the ugly and fearful ſight of Devils and Damned Spirits: the nice Smell, with the loathſome ſtench of Brimſtone, and all the moſt abominable Filthyneſs: the delicate Ears with the ſhrieks and howlings of Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Tormented wretches: the dainty Taſte, with the moſt Ravenous Hunger and Thirſt; and all the ſenſible parts, with burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devouring fire: the Imagination will have its Torment, by the apprehenſion of preſent pains, and of thoſe that are to come: the Memory by its remembrance of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures paſt, and gone, and never to returne again: the Underſtanding by the Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Happineſs loſt, and the miſery now come on. And if there be any other part which can be Tormented, it ſhall have its Torment with no more favour than the reſt. O, dear Chriſtian Brother, what ſad and dreadful things are theſe? and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably miſerable muſt thoſe be who muſt endure them? and yet this is not all; for it is certain in the ſecond place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That theſe Torments ſhall always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without any the leaſt intermiſion or decreaſe, and thoſe that ſuffer them ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find the leaſt eaſe, nor help, nor comfort: no, not for one minute: This is no more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48385:22"/>than is implyed in the places of Scripture before mentioned; the Fire will be always burning, the ſmoak ever aſcending, ſo that there ſhall be no reſt day nor night, and thoſe that are bound hand and foot will not be able to eſcape or to reſiſt, or ſtrive againſt the Torments, but muſt lye ſtill, and ſuffer all. Thus it was with the rich man, of whom our Bleſſed Saviour tels us, <hi>Luke,</hi> 16. that being in Hell, Tormented with the Fire which ſhall not be quenched, he made this requeſt to Abraham, <hi>Father Abraham have mercy on mc, and ſend Lazarus, that he</hi> may <hi>dip the tip of his finger in Water and cool my Tongue, for I am Tormented in this Flame. v,</hi> 24. What ſmaller requeſt could he poſſibly make? he deſired not a cup of water, no, nor as much as Lazarus might have held in the palm of his hand, nor yet ſo much as might have ſtuck to hid whole finger: he only deſired a drop from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rp tip of it, or not ſo much only that he <hi>would touch his Tongue with the tip of his finger</hi> a little moiſtned and cooled with water; and yet this ſmall requeſt would not be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; that little, that very little eaſe, which ſo ſmall a favour would have given him, was denyed him. Which ſad ſtory plainly ſhews us, that the Torments of the wicked have no intermiſſion, nor decreaſe, and that thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48385:22"/>who ſuffer them, ſhall never obtain the leaſt help or eaſe, though they want it moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, and ſeek for it with the greateſt earneſtneſs, and importunity. They ſhall be like to a man, that is almoſt drown'd in the mid'ſt of the Sea, who not finding any firme ground whereupon to ſet his feet, ſtretches out his hand every way, and graſpes at ſomething with all his Might, but ſtill in vain, becauſe there is nothing but water round about him: thus will it be with thoſe wretches in Hell; they are drowning in a bottomleſs gulf of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, miſeries, and they look every way for help, and ſtrive for a little eaſe; but alas to no purpoſe, for there is nothing but ſorrow, and miſery, and pain, and horror, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. And thus it ſhall be with them, not for a little time, for a Moneth, or a Year, but for ever and ever, whcih is a third thing I deſire thee to obſerve.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their pains and Torments will be endleſs as well as eaſleſs, and when they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured them without any intermiſſion, or decreaſe, as many Years, nay Ages as there are Stares in the Firmament, or ſands upon the Sea-ſhore, they ſhall ſtill be to endure them, in the very ſame manner, as many more; as many more did I ſay? yea ten thouſand more; they ſhall endure them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48385:23"/>as long as there is a juſt and Holy God to Puniſh them, that is, to eternal ages. This is but what God himſelf hath told us in plain words; for thus ſhall the ſad ſentence run at the great day, <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire;</hi> and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be accordingly, as we are told, Math. 25. the laſt v. <hi>The wicked ſhall go into everlaſting Puniſhment;</hi> into Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhall be as laſting as the rewards of the Righteous, which will be as laſting as God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe are dreadful conſiderations, my Dear Chriſtian Brother, and he muſt be a ſtrange kind of man indeed, and have a heart harder than the Adamant, that is not migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily affected with them. There are but few men ſo hardy as to think upon the Plagues, and Judgments of Almighty God upon ſinful men in this World, without ſome fear, eſpecially when they think of them as hanging over their own heads, and apprehend themſelves to be in danger of them; and how then can they chuſe but tremble at thoſe of another World, which are infinitly more dreadful than the worſt of theſe? The Evils of the World are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evils, they afflict but one, or ſome few parts at once; one diſeaſe ſeizes upon one part, and another upon another part;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48385:23"/>in one diſeaſe one ſenſe is pained, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another ſenſe, but never are all the parts and all the ſenſes, at one and the ſame time, under Torment and pain. In this World there is no Evil ſo great, but it hath its decreaſes, and changes, and therefore no man can be ſo miſerable but he will ſometimes have ſome reſpite and eaſe: and let the Evil be never ſo ſharp and preſſing, yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of hope will not be wanting, and the foreſight of a certain end will be a great relief: and yet notwithſtanding this, we many times think the Evils of this World to be intolerable; and, as ſweet a thing as Life is to us, we wiſh for Death to deliver us from them. O how intolerable then muſt the Torments of the other World be, which ſpare no part, or faculty of Body or Soul, which give not the leaſt eaſe, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the leaſt decreaſe, no not for one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; which exclude all hope of an end, and overwhelm the Soul to utter diſpair of the leaſt remedy! Let our charity lead us ſomtimes to viſite a poor Sick Creature, and let us obſerve what pains and agonies he endures for one night: mark how often he toſſes and tumbles from one ſide of his Bed to the other; hear how he groans, and what bitter complaints he makes: obſerve how he counts the hours of the Clock, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48385:24"/>how long he thinks each hour to be: how paſſionately he wiſhes for the Dawning of the day, and how tedious the night ſeems unto him. This we look upon as a ſad ſpectacle, and if we have any bowels in us, they cannot but melt at it, and when we conſider that it may be ſhortly our own caſe, we are very ſenſibly touched with it. O what ſhall we think then of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Damned! how deplorable and how miſerable muſt we needs believe that to be? to be Tormented in every member of the Body, and every faculty of the Soul, with the ſharpeſt and moſt exquiſit Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and without the leaſt eaſe or reſpit; and this not for a night of ſome few hours, but for an everlaſting night, a night that has nomorning, and knows no hope of any Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day: to lie in ſuch a night, not upon a loft Bed (as the Sick man do's) but in a Bed of Flames or a hot burning furnace; not at liberty to turn to and fro, and to ſeek eaſe, but bound hand and foot; not with the company of compaſſionate friends aſſiſting and comforting to the beſt of their power, but with the horrid company of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and accurſed Spirits, that ſhall add to their ſufferings and their ſorrows, as much as their power and malice can poſſibly do. This muſt be miſery in the height, in its full
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48385:24"/>perfection, if I may ſo ſpeak; who trembles not to think of it? who will not do any thing to eſcape it? do we fear Sickneſs and pain here, and do not we fear the pains of Hell much more? do we dread a priſon and fly from fetters and chains, and hazard our very lives to preſerve our liberty; and are we not as much afraid of that Eternal priſon, whoſe gates ſhall never be opened when once they are ſhut upon us, and from which there can be no redemption or deliverance? O dear Chriſtian Brother, are we in our right ſenſes or not? doſt thou think, and do we underſtand what theſe things mean? do they belong to us, or are they meant only for others? do we take them for the never failing truths of God or for the fables and fancies of brain-ſick men? if we underſtand them not, if we beleive them not, why do we call our ſelves Chriſtians, and make an outward profeſſion of that which in our hearts we approve not of? but if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and believe theſe things, why do we not tremble at the thoughts of them? why do we not bethink our ſelves how we may eſcape them? why do we not abhor that Sin and wickedneſs which will bring us to them? why do we not apply our ſelves with all our might, and all our care, to the Practice of that Piety and Virtue, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48385:25"/>through Gods mercy, can deliver us from them? It is an amazing thing my Brother, that theſe things ſhould make ſo little impreſſion upon the generality of Men, as we find they do; and, but that the Scripture tels us of a God of this World, that blinds the Eyes, and hardens the Hearts of Men, and makes them inconſiderate as Brutes, we ſhould be at a loſs to give any account of it. We ſee, that they are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive enough of Evil in this World, and induſtrious enough to avoid it; if any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be great, though it be remote, they dread it, and though it's Coming be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, yet they take care to prevent it. But alas! as to theſe unſpeakable Evils and Calamities, they are ſtupid and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as blocks, the leaſt fear of them is full enough, and the leaſt care and pains to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them is thought too much. Surely Brother, there was a time when they had greater effects upon the world, than now they have, when men thought they could not be poſſeſſed with too great fear of them, nor take too much care and pains to eſcape them. Let me ſhew thee what a devout Father has written concerning ſome peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents he once ſaw in a Monaſtery, and then judge what inſluence theſe things have had heretofore upon men,<note place="margin">St. J. Climac. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48385:25"/>what they ought in reaſon to have now. <q>When Firſt I came into this Monaſtery (ſaies he) I beheld certain things which neither the eyes of the ſluggard have ever ſeen, nor the ears of the negligent heard, nor yet may it be conceiv'd in the heart of any careleſs and retchleſs Chriſtians. And afterwards he tels us, how he ſaw many penitents ſtanding with their eyes fixed towards Heaven, continually calling upon Almighty God with tears and ſighs for pardon and mercy: others again, he ſaw, that proſeſſed they were nto worthy to liſt up their eyes towards Heaven, or to ſpeak to Almighty God, and theſe held their faces down towards the ground, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their Souls in ſilence to the mercy of God, without ſpeaking ſo much as one word, as men that had been Dumb, full of fear and confuſion. Others were cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sacks, and Hair-cloath, and kneeling with their faces bowed down to their knees, and ſmiteing their foreheads oftentines upon the Earth; did bathe the very Earth with their tears, and thoſe, that wanted tears did lament very grievouſly, becauſe they wanted them. And after this, he tells us, that they had death continually before their eyes; and ſpeaking one to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother they ſaid, How think ye Brethren?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48385:26"/>what ſhall become of us at the dreadful hour? ſhall the ſentence of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be revoked? or ſhall our Prayers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance come into our Lords Ears? or if they do, how ſhall they be received? and what profit ſhall we rcceive by them? for ſince they proceed out of ſuch unclean Lips, it is to be feared, they may find but little favour in his ſight. And much more to this purpoſe. To which others would anſwer, as the penitent ſinners in <hi>Nineve,</hi> Who knows whether the Lord will Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, whether he will turn himſelf to us, and not ſuffer us to periſh: let us now take Courage and perſevere continually in Crying unto him till the end; for the Lord is merciful, and will be pacified with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance: let us run, my Brethren, let us run with all ſpeed, and return to the palce from whence we are fallen, and let us in no wiſe pardon this filthy fleſh which hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done us; but ſince it hath Crucified us, let us Crucifie it.</q> And then, he proceeds to tel us how hardly they treated their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, how they watched, and faſted, and puniſhed themſelves for their oftences againſt God, inſomuch as that their faces were like <q>the faces of dead men, and their very Eyes were ſunck into their heads through over much weakneſs.</q> And after all this he tels us
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48385:26"/>how they behaved themſelves when any of their Brethren lay a dying. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Bed of the dying Man, and with earneſt, and vehement requeſts, with move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenances and pitiful words they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, <q>How do'ſt thou Brother? how feeleſt thou thy ſelf? what Hope haſt thou? what ſhall become of thee? haſt thou obtained thy long ſuit? Art thou arrived at the Haven of thy Salvation? haſt thou received any carneſt-penny of thy ſecurity? haſt thou heard any voice within thee, which ſaid, thy ſins be forgiven thee, or thy faith hath made the whole? or haſt thou peradventure heard any other voice which ſaid unto thee. The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the nations that forget God, or, Bind him Hand and Foot and caſt him into utter Darkneſs? What anſwer makeſt thou, good Brother, unto us? Tel us ſomething, we beſeech thee, that we may underſtand by thee, what is reſerved for us; for thy ſuite is now come to an end, and what ſentence thou ſhalt now receive ſhall never more be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed: but our caſE as yet ſtil dependeth, and looketh for ſentence. To which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſome anſwered. Bleſſed be the Lord that hath not ſuffered us to be caſt into the teeth of our enemies: but others
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48385:27"/>after a more doleful manner; Miſerable is that Soul that hath not fully obſerved his profeſſion, for now ſhall he well underſtand what is prepared for him.</q> Theſe, my dear Brother, were men that did in good earneſt believe the Truths of the Goſpel concerning another World, and being fully perſwaded that the puniſhments appointed for wicked men are moſt intolerable, were as fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deliver themſelves from them, though by the greateſt pains and the ſevereſt mortifications. Theſe were men that made Uſe of that Faith, and of that Reaſon and Underſtanding which God hath given them; and ſince they thought it Prudence to be apprehenſive of leſſer Dangers, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare againſt more inconſiderable Evils; they would not, like the unruly Horſe that ſtarts at a Bird, and runs himſelf into a Precipice, be fearleſs of the greateſt Dangers, and ſuffer themſelves to fall into the moſt inſufferable Calamities. And are not we concern'd, my Brother, to do the like, and to make the like Uſe of that Faith, and Reaſon which God hath given us? D'os not the Fire of Hell burn as furiouſly now as ever it did? Have thoſe everlaſting Torments had any end or period preſcribed them ſince that time? or are we more able to wreſtle with them, or to endure them, than they were? or have we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48385:27"/>any eaſier way of eſcaping them diſcovered to us, than was known to them? what eaſie wayes our Luſts may find out, I do not know; but ſure I am, that there is but one ſafe and ſure way, but one way of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which was made known to them, as it is to us, and that is, the way of ſerving God ſincerely, and with all our might, in a Holy and Vertuous Life; which if we fail to do, we ſhall, as certainly as God is true, be condemned to theſe everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Judg then, dear Brother, whether we have not reaſon to ſerve God, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not madneſs to live in that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and ungodly way which we ſee moſt men do. But now becauſe theſe things may ſeem very ſevere, and poſſibly occaſion in thee ſome hard thoughts of Almighty God, I muſt deſire thee to conſider,</p>

                     <p>Containing a Fifth Argument to a Holy Life, from the Conſideration of thoſe great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God hath prepared for good Men in the other World, the greatneſs of which may be in ſome meaſure estimated, <hi>1.</hi> From Gods Kindneſs to Good Men even in this World. <hi>2.</hi> That the Reward is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to our deſerts, which are very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but to the goodneſs of God, which is infinite. And <hi>3.</hi> Is deſigned as the most glorious manifeſtation of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And <hi>4.</hi> It is the Purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood, and the Reward of his Obedience and Sufferings, which are of Infinite Merit.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Reward, which Almighty God hath prepared in another World for thoſe, that ſerve him faithfully in this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Obligations that lye upon them, both as Men and Chriſtians. And this Conſideration, I doubt not, will be as Pleaſant, and Delightful, as the laſt was Sad, and Dreadful; and will no leſs declare Gods Goodneſs and Mercy, than that did his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Severity. I preſume, I need not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48385:28"/>tell thee, that ſuch is our condition, that no Reward of right does belong to any Services we can do; and therefore be the rewad great, or little, which God hath prepared for us, we muſt acknowledge our ſelves indebted to his Infinite Goodneſs for it, and that it is on our parts altogether undeſerved; how much more then muſt we acknowledge our ſelves indebted to his Goodneſs, (and what a ſtrong obligation ſhould we reckon it to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) when the Reward he hath deſigned for us, is not little, like our Services; but great, great, as we can imagine it to be, as our hearts can deſire it ſhould be? To give thee a little ſight of the greatneſs of this Reward, for it is not poſſible for thee, or me, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it fully, I might lead thee through a multitude of Conſiderations; but I ſhall reſtrain my ſelf to ſome few, which I think do deſerve thy ſerious regard. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We cannot but acknowledge, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is very kind to his Servants in this World, and there is not one of them can ſay that he ſerveth God for nought, as to this preſent life. God hath given them many good Promiſes, and do's give them many good things daily according to thoſe Promiſes. They have a competent ſhare in all the good things of the World, and ſuch a bleſſing together with them, as makes them
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48385:29"/>much more ſweet and pleaſant to them, than all the poſſeſſions of the wicked; and though they have their Afflictions, and their Tryals, yet they have their Pleaſures and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; they have a Peace within which none can diſturb, and ſuch Joyes as none can take from them, I mean the peace of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the joyes of the Holy Ghoſt; they are either free from all Calamities, or they have ſuch ſupport under them, that they are rather matter of Joy than Sorrow to them: God is good to them at all times in a great meaſure, but ſometimes more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and in a meaſure extraordinary; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the great things that he hath done in all Ages for them; What great Deliverances hath he often given them? What cunning Plots and Devices againſt them hath he brought to naught? What Wonders hath he wrought in their behalf? and how Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, when they have been in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Diſtreſs, has he made them to triumph over all their Enemies? So that, thoſe who have beheld it, have been conſtrain'd to cry out in the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, doubtelſs there is a God that judgeth the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 58. 11. Now if God deal thus kindly with his Servants here, what kindneſs do'ſt thou think will he ſhew them hereafter? If whileſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48385:29"/>they are in doing his work, he beſtows ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things upon them, what may they expect from him when his work is done? and if in the time of their tryal they receive ſuch great benefits from him, what ſhall they receive (thinkeſt thou) when their tryal is ended, and they are fully approved? If ſuch great things be done for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Service, what great things are deſigned (may we believe) for their Reward? Eſpecially conſidering,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Reward, which God intends for them, ſhall not be proportioned to the little Merit of their Services, but to his own Infinite Goodneſs: it ſhall not be ſuch as the Services do deſerve, but ſuch as becomes him to beſtow. It is a <hi>Gift,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. and ſuch a gift as ſhall ſhew the Inſinite goodneſs and Beneficence of the Donor. Yea</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a gift, that is deſigned for to ſhew it. God intends the fulleſt manifeſtation of his Goodneſs by it, that he may receive Everlaſting Praiſes, both from Men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And how exceeding great muſt that gift be? When a Prince rewards the Services of a poor Subject, he conſiders not ſo much what his Loyal Subject deſerves, as what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48385:30"/>himſelf to beſtow; and though the ſervice may be but mean, yet he muſt give as a Prince, largely and freely, with reſpect to his Honour: but if a Prince deſign in rewarding a Servant to ſhew his Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and Liberality to the utmoſt, and to do himſelf the greateſt honour he can he will give the greateſt things his Kingdom will afford; and in the nobleſt and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable way. O how great then and how good will that Reward be which the King of Kings, the Supream Ruler and Governor of the World will give to his Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? How little leſs than Infinite muſt that be, which will become ſo Glorious a Majeſty to beſtow? Eſpecially ſince he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to manifeſt his Goodneſs and Bounty in the higheſt meaſure? and to let all the World know, how much he deſerved the love and ſervice of all his Creatures. When God before the foundations of the World, did deſign to declare his Power and wiſdom and Goodneſs, what a World did he create? What Beautiful Heavens? what glittering Stars? what Elements? and in how mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous a manner did he unite, and compact them together? and yet he intended this Vaſt, and Beautiful Building, to laſt but for a time, and then to be deſtroyed; and he knew that the nobleſt of his Creatures, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48385:30"/>he made to inhabit it, would be rebellious againſt him, and few of them give him his due honour and obedience. Imagine then what he will do, when he deſigns the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt manifeſtation of his Almighty Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in rewarding his Faithful Servants: what a Glorious Place will he make for them? what Riches and Honors will he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon them? will they not be as great, as his Infinite Goodneſs can beſtow, or as his Infinite Wiſedom can judge to be becoming it? and how incomparably great muſt we needs judg thoſe to be? And yet we may Conſider further,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That this Reward deſigned for Gods Servants, is that, which Chriſt hath received from his Father, to give them, for all his pains and tears and ſweat and blood: that it is the Purchaſe of the Blood of the Son of God, and the recompence of his Obedience to the death. Now how great a Reward muſt ſo Beloved a Son deſerve by ſo great and perfect and Obedience? Can any thing, how excellent ſoever, be thought too good for him, or too great a recompence for his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings? if, conſidering our own poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices we could not hope for ſuch manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods Goodneſs as I have ſpoken of, yet conſidering the Merits of Chriſt, we have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48385:31"/>no reaſon to doubt of them; for if Infinite Goodneſe can admit of any motive to ſhew it ſelf to the utmoſt, this muſt needs be the greateſt, and moſt prevailing. And yet further, to raiſe our Thoughts one degree higher, we may conſider,</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Containing a proſecution of the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That this Reward of Good Men muſt be very great; Becauſe, <hi>5.</hi> It is not only the Reward Chriſt purchaſed for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but that alſo which he obtained for himſelf, as the Recompence of his Obedience and Sufferings, with a more particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, wherein this Happineſs conſiſts; a Serious Expoſtulation with thoſe, who ſlight it, and the neceſſity of Holineſs for the obtaining of it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="5">5. THis Reward is not only as the Reward which Chriſt obtained for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but as the Reward which he obtained for himſelf, as the very Recompence which his Heavenly Father hath given him, for his Obedience; for that it is the very ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which he has received, that his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhall enjoy, the Scriptures teach us plainly. We learn it from his own Mouth,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48385:31"/>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.21. where he bids the faithful Servant, that had improved his Talents to his advantage, <hi>to enter into the joy of his Lord;</hi> and one of his choſen Servants, that knew as much of this matter as any man ever did, hath told us the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. where he expreſly affirms, <hi>that we are heirs of God, and co-heirs with Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> So that whatever glory, or joy, or riches, or honours Chriſt is poſſeſſed of upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Obedience, that ſhall all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants enjoy together with him. Has God exalted him for his Obedience, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a Kingdom above all Kingdoms? it is as certain, that his Servants ſhall be exalted likewiſe, and <hi>reign together with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.5. Is Chriſt aſcended into the higheſt Heavens, and do's he dwell in the Boſome of his Father? it is as certain, that he ſhall come one day from Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all his Servants to himſelf, <hi>that where he is, they may be alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.3. Is that frail and mortal body, which he had whil'ſt he was upon the Earth, and which ſuffered the Pains and Torments of the Croſs, changed into a glorious, immortal, impaſſible Body? it is as certain, <hi>that the vile bodies of his</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>ſhall be ſo changed likewiſe, and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like to his glorious Body, according to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48385:32"/>to himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3.21. Is that Glory, which he is exalted to, that Joy and Happineſs, which he is poſſeſſed of, never to have an end? it is as certain, that the Glory and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of his Servants ſhall be as laſting; for <hi>it is an Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Peter, <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 4. This, dear Brother, is the reward of Gods Faithful Servants; and can thy Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing greater, or they Soul wiſh for any thing more? Canſt thou conceive what it is to put off this vile mortal body, with all its Evil affections, and uneaſie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, to be freed from all defects and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, from all diſeaſes and diſtempers, all infirmities and deformities; to be like to the Angels in Heaven, and having put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption and immortality, to ſhine like the Sun in the Firmament, in the Kingdom of God? Canſt thou conceive what a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it will be, to be with Chriſt, to behold the bleſſed face of that Dear Perſon, who do's ſo highly deſerve of us, both upon the ſcore of his Infinite Perfections, and likewiſe upon the account of his Ineſtimable Benefits? Canſt thou conceive what a happineſs it will be to <hi>behold God face to face,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expreſſions are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. or <hi>to ſee him as he is,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. that is, to have the moſt clear, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48385:32"/>knowledg of him, that finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can poſſibly have: to know all his adorable Perfections, his Almighty Power, his Incomprehenſible Wiſdom, his Eternal Juſtice, his reſplendent Purity and Holineſs, his Immeaſureable Goodneſs and Love; and to feel the mighty power of this knowledg upon our Souls transforming us into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and uniting our Wills moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to him, whereby we ſhall both poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs God, and be poſſeſſed of him? Can'ſt thou conceive what a happineſs it will be, for Millions of Millions of ſuch God-like Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be inſeparably together, and with united Hearts and Mouths to be continually ſinging Songs of Praiſe to the great God of Love, who loved them Infinitely, and taught them to love him again, and one another? And can'ſt thou think how much it will add to their Happineſs, to have a full and perfect aſſurance, That it ſhall never have an end; that it ſhall be as laſting as 'tis great, and never know the leaſt diminution, or decay? I know, Brother, that all this is far above tho Reach of they moſt raiſed thoughts; it is too great a happineſs to enter into the heart of Man: as <hi>fleſh and bloud cannot inherit it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. that is, as Man in his preſent weak and corruptible eſtate cannot be partaker of it, ſo neither can he comprehend it: when we and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48385:33"/>poſſeſſed of it, then, and not till then, ſhall we fully underſtand it. O Bleſſed God! why art thou thus good to ungrateful and unworthy men? Why haſt thou prepared ſuch a happineſs for thoſe, who neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, nor ſeek after it? Why is ſuch a Price put into the hands of fools, who have not the hearts to make Uſe of it, who fondly chuſe to gratifie their luſts, rather than to ſave their Souls, and fooliſhly prefer the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Enjoyments of Sin, and folly, before a glorious and happy immortality? Vain and fooliſh Men! how is it that you underſtand not your own greateſt intereſt? That that Reaſon and Judgment which in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters conſtantly attends you, does in this, which is of the greateſt moment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to you, ſo ſtrangely fail you? Does not all the World ſee, that you deſire, and ſeek after ſuch things, as you apprehend to be good, and that you are more, or leſs careful in ſeeking after ſuch things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the value you put upon them, and the eſteem you have for them? for a ſmall Eſtate you will take great Pains, you will run great hazards, and ſuffer great hardſhips; for a great eſtate you will do and ſuffer more and for a Crown, or Kingdom yet more; and why then will you not do and ſuffer as much for this Glorious and Eternal Reward, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48385:33"/>far tranſcends all the Riches and the Glories of the World? The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tels us, That <hi>Moſes</hi> did deſpiſe the Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Pleaſures of the Court of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for this Reward. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11 c. 24, 25 v. And that a multitude of Wiſe and Holy men <hi>have had tryal of cruel Mockings and Scourgings, of Bonds and Impriſonment,</hi> and have ſuffered patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea joyfully the worſt things that wicked Men and Devils could inflict upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had their Eyes upon it, and hoped to obtain it. And St. <hi>Austin,</hi> I remember, profeſſes, that he could be content to do or ſuffer any thing, yea to ſuffer the torments of Hell for a time, that he might come to Heaven at laſt. And why is it, Brother, that we have not as great an eſteem of it? or if we have why do we not labour, why are we not willing to do and ſuffer as much for it? Do'ſt thou think, Brother, that this Care and Pains, which I ſpeak of, is needleſs as to the obtaining of it? or may we hope for it from Gods mercy and goodneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that ſtrict and holy Life, which I have ſpoken of? What? Do'ſt thou believe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to be a liar, or that he is not in earneſt, when he tels thee, That <hi>without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man ſhall ſee Him, Heb.</hi> 12 14 does not a reward neceſſarily relate to ſervice, and can'ſt thou expect the Reward though thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48385:34"/>do'ſt no ſervice? Canſt thou imagine, that ſuch a reward, a reward ſo great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the very beſt of men, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſes of God, dare hardly preſume to hope for it, ſhall be given to thoſe that are Slaves to their own luſts, and either ſerve not God at all, or no farther than their Luſts will give them leave? What? is this a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for Apoſtates from God, for Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt Heaven, for thoſe that deſire it not, or value it not, but prefer the Pleaſures of Sin and the Profits of the World before it? What? will it be the ſame thing as to another World, whether men anſwer the end of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or not, whether they diſhonour their holy profeſſion by an unholy life or not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they love God or not, whether they follow the example of Chriſt or not, and in one word, whether they be meet for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory and Felicity, by pure and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſpoſitions, and the Participation of the Divine nature; or be ever ſo unmeet for it, by brutiſh Luſts or Diveliſh Qualities, and diſpoſitions? There is a vaſt difference, dear Brother, between Heaven and Hell, no leſs than there is between light and darkneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the greateſt happineſs and the greateſt miſery; and ought not there to be a vaſt difference likewiſe between thoſe that ſhall enjoy the one, and thoſe that ſhall fall under
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48385:34"/>the other? Can a holy and righteous God make ſo great difference between the eternal eſtates of men, as to make ſome eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and others eternally miſerable, who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer here one from another in little or nothing, but only in a little outward profeſſion, or the obſervation of ſome few Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, or in a formal and civil carriage or demeanour? Surely, Brother, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that theſe things ſhould enter into the head of any ſober and conſidering man, and therefore thou muſt needs acknowledge the neceſſity of living a holy life, if thou hopeſt for the Heavenly Glory and Felicity; and is not the Heavenly Glory encouragement enough for thee to do ſo? will not that make thee ſufficient amends for the greateſt Care and Pains thou can'ſt take, for the worſt things thou can'ſt ſuffer, or the greateſt hazards thou can'ſt poſſibly run by it? Yes, undoubtedly it will; and therefore I leave the exhortation of the Apoſtle with thee 1 Corinth. 15 58 v. <hi>Therefore my beloved Brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, alwayes alounding in the work of the Lord, for aſmuch as you know that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> I ſhall add but one thing more; and I will diſpatch it in few words, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing a Sixth Argument to a Holy Life, from conſidering, That theſe Rewards and Puniſhments are not ſo far off, as ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vainly imagine; with the Concluſion of this firſt Part.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="6">6. THat thou wouldeſt Conſider theſe Rewards and Puniſhments which I have ſpoken of, not as things at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from thee, but as they are indeed, and in truth, very near unto thee. There is but a little part of a very ſhort life, of a life which, at longeſt, is but a Span long, between thee and them: we have at moſt but ſome few Breaths to draw before we muſt paſs into our Eternal ſtate, and be either happy, or miſerable, without any manner of Change or alteration for ever: Death is continually laying his ſnares for us, and has ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unknown wayes to do his work upon us, that we live every moment, as it were by miracle; and it is a much ſtranger thing that we have lived till this day, than it would be, if we ſhould dye before the morrow. 'Tis true, we are apt to flatter our ſelves with hopes of long life; but how fond ſuch hopes are, the unexpected Fall of ſome,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48385:35"/>or other, every day about us, if nothing elſe will do it, may convince us. There are thouſands now in their Graves, that came no ſooner into the World than we, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to live as long, as we can do, in it: and what are we, and what are our hopes, that both may not be cut off within few hours? and why may not we make our beds in the duſt as much ſooner than we expect, as they have done? Now tell me, Brother, haſt thou ſo low an opinion of the heavenly glory and felicity, as that it cannot engage thee to ſerve God ſo little a time for it? or have Hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo little of Terrour in them, that thou can'ſt not reſolve to under go ſo ſhort a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid them? or is there any thing in this World which can make thee neglect a matter of ſo great importance to thee, when thou thinkeſt how little a while thou can'ſt enjoy it? The Hiſtories of our Countrey tell us of a <hi>Saxon</hi> Queen in this Land, that by an innocent and happy piece of Policy, prevailed with her Husband to leave his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, and to live Chriſtianly: She did it thus; There was a day when the King and his Favourites did feaſt and frolick, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner; and She, as ſoon as their Mirth was ended, cauſed the ſame place to be covered with dung and filthineſs, and to be made as loathſom as poſſible: and when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48385:36"/>ſhe had done, ſhe deſired the King to repair thither, and to look upon the late Scene of their Mirth and Jollity; which th King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, and muſing in his mind of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Change, She took the opportunity to ask him where all the mirth of the paſt day was, and what footſteps did now remain of it? were not all ſuch things as wind, and vanity, which paſs away in an inſtant, and are not to be recalled? And with theſe and the like ſpeeches, ſhe taught him to deſpiſe the world, and to ſeek after the Kingdom of Heaven. I ſhall make no other Uſe of the Story, than to beſeech thee to reſlect upon thy life paſt, and to conſider what is become of all thy former Pleaſures: I know that they are all paſt and gone, and that the time is coming when as much may be ſaid of all thy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments; they will be as far from thee, and as uſeleſs to thee, as all thy paſt pleaſures are now: In the hour of Death, and from that hour to all Eternity, thou mayſt ſay with them in the Book of <hi>Wiſedom, What hath Pride profited us? and what good hath Riches with all our vaunting brought us? all thoſe things are paſſed away like a ſhadow, or like a Poſt that haſted by.</hi> And therefore be ſo wiſe for thy own Good, as to contemn theſe worthleſs fugitive things, and for the little remainder of thy life, to endeavour to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48385:36"/>make ſure of the better, and more abiding things, which God hath prepared for thee in Heaven. Thou haſt ſometime, perhaps, been viſited with Sickneſs, and haſt thought thy ſelf to be upon the borders of the Grave: call to mind, I beſeech thee, what thoughts did then poſſeſs thee: Did'ſt thou not then look upon the World as vanity? and did not all thy paſt Follies torment thee with a bitter remembrance? Did not the few good things that thou had'ſt done, pleaſe thee better than all the World? and did'ſt not heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that thy whole life was not imployed in ſuch good wayes? Remember, I beſeech thee, that it will ſhortly come to that again; the evil day is at hand, and thy preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights will be vaniſhed, and thy worldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments be uſeleſs and unprofitable; and if thou haſt not the Conſcience of a good life to cheer thee, thou wilt be miſerable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help or remedy. O prepare, prepare, dear Brother, for that time, by a holy and Chriſtian Life, and let nothing upon Earth divert, or hinder thee. Why ſhould that rob thee of thy greateſt Bliſs, which will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thee in the leaſt when thou haſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt need of it? Why ſhould that make thee miſerable for ever, which cannot make thee happy for a little time? Remender thy End, ſaid a Wiſe Man, and thou ſhalt never
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48385:37"/>do amiſs. He that knowes, that he ſtands upon the brink of Eternity, is a bold fool if he dares do wickedly. He is mad that will commit a Crime this day, who knows that before the next he may be bearing the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of it in everlaſting Sorrows.</p>
               <p>Thus have I laid before thee, dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome Arguments and Motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to a Holy Life: and ſo I have brought the Firſt Part of my intended Work to an end. The things that I have offered to thee, I am ſure deſerve thy ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: let them be conſidered according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuffer them to have their due influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon thee, and I ſhall give thee no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble in this matter. Weigh them well, and according to the Reaſon thou findeſt in them, ſo do; and I ask no more of thee. Live, as a man created by God on purpoſe to know and love and ſerve him here, and to enjoy him for ever hereafter, ought to live. Live, as a man advanced to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and profeſſion of Chriſtianity, is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to live. Live, as a man that muſt give an account hereafter of his whole Life to a juſt and impartial Judge, is in all reaſon bound to live. Live, as one that believes that he ſhall be unſpeakably, and Eternally miſerable, if he live amiſs; and that he ſhall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48385:37"/>be eternally happy, if he live as he ought. Live, as one that knows that he has but a ſhort life to live, a life that is but a moment in reſpect of Eternity, and that (yet) upon this little moment his Eternal ſtate does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. In a word. Live, as a man dying, haſtening to the Grave, and to the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, and to everlaſting Bliſs, or Woe, muſt needs think himſelf concerned to live. Live thus, dear Brother, and I have my Deſire. Only let me beg thy Prayers, that I may live thus likewiſe, that both of us may be happy for ever. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> Containing the Firſt Advice, Seriouſly to Reſolve upon a Holy Life; the neceſſity of ſuch a Reſolution, and the great Virtue and Efficacy of it. <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Containing ſome Directions how to form a laſting Reſolution. Firſt, to reſolve ſoberly and deliberately, not raſhly and in haſt; maturely to conſider what it is we muſt reſolve, and carefully to examine all the advantages and diſadvantages on both ſides. Secondly, to take the matter into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeveral diſtinct times, before we fix our reſolution. Thirdly, to back this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with a ſolemn Vow. <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> A proſecution of the ſame Argument, containing ſome further Directions in making a laſting reſolution; as Fourthly, to write down our Reſolutions in the words wherin we make them, and to engage our ſelves to God in a ſolemn Bond and Contract. And Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to make known this reſolution to the World, as often as a fit occaſion offers, which very much tends to the golry of God, delivers us from many temptations, and makes us more ſtedfast to what we reſolve. And Sixthly,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48385:39"/>to ſeek out ſome good men who have taken up the ſame Reſolutions, and to contract an intimate Friendſhip and Acquaintance with them; or, if we cannot find any ſuch, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade our old Friends and Companions to enter into ſuch a Religious Friendſhip.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To Reſolve upon it.</hi> Make an abſolute, and peremptory Reſolution to live a Holy Life. <q>I ſee, it is neceſſary that I ſhould do ſo, (may'ſt thou ſay) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy for ever, if I do not live ſo; and therefore I am reſolved, I will live ſo, and nothing ſhall divert or hinder me.</q> Without this peremptory Reſolution, thou wilt never be able to do what thou may'ſt deſire: Thou may'ſt begin well, but wilt fail to perſevere to the end. Thou wilt be as the double-minded man, which St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>unstable in thy wayes:</hi> one while in the good way, and another while in the bad, according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thy life, and the Sway of thy incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. But with this reſolution begin and proſper. Reſolution worketh wonders every day in other matters; and in this, be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it will do much more; becauſe God will bleſs it. It hath a mighty efficacy in it ſelf, and whoever is poſſeſſed of it, ſeldom
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48385:40"/>ſails to bring his Deſigns to paſs. It makes a man intent upon the thing he would do, inquiſitive after the beſt means to effect it, watchful and ready to lay hold upon all fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting opportunities, jealous of the leaſt Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments and Hindrances, bold and conſtant in the midſt of difficulties and dangers, and ſo excludes that forgetfulneſs &amp; Inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that Negligence and Sloth, that Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Levity, that Doubtfulneſs and Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs, which overthrows the good Purpoſes of many, and fruſtrates their beſt Deſigns. But how much greater will the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of it be, thinkeſt thou, when it is backed with the Almighty Grace of God, which in this matter will be ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to it? The truth is, thy work is half done when thou art fully reſolved, and if thy reſolution fail not, I dare promiſe thee as good ſucceſs as thy heart can wiſh. But then care muſt be taken that thy reſolutiou continue firm, and ſtrong; and that it may do ſo, thou muſt obſerve the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Thou muſt make it ſoberly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, not raſhly and in haſt. Thou muſt conſider what thou art about to reſolve upon, what difficulties, and diſcouragements, thou art like to meet with, and what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48385:40"/>and Inconveniences may attend thee in it. And when thou haſt done this, thou muſt conſult thy own Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, upon theſe and the like Queſtions: <q>Is it reaſonable that I ſhould undertake, and reſolve upon ſuch a buſineſs as this is? is it poſſible for me to effect it? can I march through all the difficulties, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the Tempatations which may or can befall me in it? Is the Deſign honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and worthy of a man? and can I hope for a ſufficient Recompence for all the Troubles it will put me to?</q> And, for the Avoiding of all error and miſtake, it will not be amiſs for thee, to put down in write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (if thou can'ſt) all that thou art to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider upon, as alſo thy judgment and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination upon every particular. However, fail not to get as clear and diſtinct an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of every thing as poſſibly thou can'ſt, and let nothing paſs thee without due conſideration. Run through all the parts and duties of a holy life in thy thoughts, and tell thy Heart, <q>This I muſt do; this I muſt fly from; this I muſt ſuffer; Almighty God requires it, and I cannot hope to be excuſed in any thing. Tell me, O my heart, (may'ſt thou ſay) wilt thou be content I ſhall do it, or not? Wilt thou not prove falſe to me, if I do reſolve it?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48385:41"/>Theſe things I muſt attend to, not for a few days only, or at ſome certain times and ſeaſons, but conſtantly and perpetually, throughtout the whole courſe of my life: It muſt be my buſineſs to obey and pleaſe God in all my wayes, and all my worldly affairs and fleſhly Pleaſures muſt give place to it. Tell me, O my heart, how do'ſt thou approve of this? Have I thy free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to undertake it? and wilt thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tne that I now begin it?</q> And then, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe within thy ſelf the greateſt temptations, that can befall thee, to diſcourage and draw thee aſide, ſuppoſe that thy Mother who bare thee in her Womb, and nouriſhed thee with her Breaſts, and loves thee as her life, ſhould come with weeping eyes to thee, and, with the moſt melting expreſſions that Love and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row could put into her mouth, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee to do ſome wicked act, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the doing of thy duty in any matter: And ſuppoſe the Wife of thy boſome, who is as thy very Soul, ſhould joyn with her in the ſame deſire, and tell thee, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did <hi>Sampſon, Judg.</hi> 16.5. <hi>how can'st thou ſay I love thee, when thy heart is not with me?</hi> And, it may be, thy deareſt Friends and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars may be importunate with thee alſo for the ſame thing; And then ſay unto thy ſelf, <q>Shall I be able to withſtand all theſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48385:41"/>temptations, to reſiſt the Importunities of a kind and tender Mother, to turn my back upon the Wife of my Boſome, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige all my Friends, rather than ſin againſt God, and wound my own conſcience?</q> And further, repreſent unto thy ſelf the worſt things that can befall a man in this World, as likely to befal thy ſelf for thy Conſcience towards God: Suppoſe thou muſt loſe all thou haſt in the World, yea and thy very life, if thou wilt not ſin againſt him; ſuppoſe thou muſt ſuffer the ſharpeſt Reproaches, and the moſt cruel death that ever was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, if thou wilt be faithful to him, and do thy duty: And then charge thy Heart to tell thee, whether it will not ſink at ſuch a tryal, and baſely betray thee to Sin and Shame. <q>Theſe are hard things indeed, (may'ſt thou ſay) the bare thoughts of them are dreadful; and how much more will the things themſelves be, when thou comeſt to try them But what good thing was ever obtained without ſome difficulty? and what wiſe man was ever diſcouraged with difficulties, that was ſure of a recompenſe far exceeding the worſt of Troubles he could poſſibly undergo? Is it not reaſonable that I ſhould do and ſuffer any thing that my God ſhall impoſe upon me? Should not that Life and Being which he hath given
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48385:42"/>me, be altogether at his ſervice? May not my dear and loving Saviour juſtly expect as much from me, ſince he hath purchaſed me with his moſt precious blood? did not he undergo much more for my ſake, than he requires me to do for his? and may not that joy which encouraged him, be a juſt. Encouragement for me? will not Heaven make Amends for all, and juſtifie my choice and reſolution to all the World? What if I am weak and frail? What if there be many ſubtle Enemies to this my Undertaking? Is not he that is with me, greater than all that are againſt me? Cannot the Spirit of my God make my weakneſs ſtrong, and cauſe me to triumph over all my adverſaries? has not he done as much for Millions of ſuch Weaklings as I am? Have not old men, notwithſtanding the Infirmities of Age; and young men, notwithſtanding the ſtrength of their Luſts; and women, notwithſtanding the frailty of their ſex, taken up the very ſame reſolution, and in ſpight of all the Powers of darkneſs and their accurſed Inſtruments made it good to the laſt minute of their lives? I know, I know, my God and Saviour will not fail me in ſo good an Undertaking, and he will make my weakneſs to redound to the Glory of his Grace; and therefore I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48385:42"/>my, I muſt, I will, I do reſolve upon a holy life.</q> Thus I do adviſe thee, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things before thou do'ſt reſolve, that thy reſolution may be the work of thy whole Soul, that thy Underſtanding may fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it under the moſt diſadvantagious Circumſtances, and thy Will entirely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and that nothing may befal thee in thy after-life that may ſtagger thee as not foreſeen, or cauſe thee to queſtion the wiſdom of thy Undertaking. And this advice (thou muſt know) is not the meer iſſue of my own brains, but the Counſel of our great and good Maſter in two plain Parables, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28, 29. <hi>v.</hi> &amp;c. <q>
                     <hi>Which of you,</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down first, and counteth the Coſt, whether he have ſufficient to finiſh it? leſt happily after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it begin to mock him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this man began to build, and was not able to finiſh it. Or what King, going to make war againſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſidereth whether he be able with Ten thouſand to meet him that cometh against him with Twenty thouſand, or elſe whilst the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an Embaſſage, and deſireth conditions of Peace.</hi>
                  </q> Which Parables do plainly tell us, That no wiſe man will begin to build, but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48385:43"/>upon fore-ſight that he ſhall be able to finiſh That no wiſe King will begin a War, without firſt conſidering his ability to go through with it. Nor can he be thought wiſe, that will take upon him to be a diſciple of Chriſt, and to follow him in a holy Life, before he hath well conſidered what he undertakes, and what Trouble and Danger it may coſt him to do ſo; the fruits of ſuch raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed Undertakings can ordinarily be no other than ſhame and ſorrow. If Religion be once throughly wrought into the heart, (which will not be done in an hour, or two, and can be done by no better way than by frequent meditations) it will in all probability keep poſſeſſion of it for ever: And if a man be once reſolved upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Piety and Vertue, from a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the goodneſs, and reaſonableneſs of it, he will hardly be turned aſide from it, by any temptation; whereas, if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the borders or the skirts of the Soul only, poſſeſs the fancy or Imagination, and by the help of it alone does warn the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, it will in a little time, be caſt off, and all the good Purpoſes, which it may for the preſent produce, will, upon the leaſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Circumſtances, be forgotten, or laid aſide.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48385:43"/>
               <p> §. 2. And therefore in the ſecond place, I ſhall commend to thee, that thou do not fully determine, and fix thy reſolution upon once conſidering, or deliberating, (how ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſoever thou haſt done it) but that thou take the matter twice or thrice into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, after ſome little Intermiſſions: for ſo thou wilt diſcern, whether thy reſolution be the effect of thy Judgment, and thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire choice; or of a good temper of body apt to receive Religious Impreſſions; and a kindly heat, kindled by the working of thy Imagination. If it be the good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and warm Imagination that diſpoſes thee to it, thou wilt be of another mind after thou haſt ſlept, or been dealing in other matters: But, if it proceed from the better Principle, but now mentioned, what thou approveſt of this day, thou wilt approve of to morrow, and for ever; and the more thou conſidereſt things, the better thou wilt like of thy intended reſolution, and the more ready thou wilt be, fully and finally to fix it. What thou haſt conſidered one day, then, in order to a reſolution, my Counſel is, That thou taken a Review of it the next day: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afreſh what thou art to do, conſider the Pleaſures which thou muſt forſake, and the difficulties thou muſt undergo; and if, after all, thou findeſt thy ſelf ſincerely bent
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48385:44"/>to ſerve the Lord in a Holy and Chriſtian Life; and no objection offers it ſelf, which thou perceiveſt thy heart to ſtumble at, then fix thy reſolution, reſolve fully, perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily and irrevocably. And that it may have all the ſtrength, which we can poſſibly add to it, let me adviſe thee further,</p>
               <p>§. 3. To back it with a Vow, with a ſolemn proteſtation to Almighty God, to keep it firm and ſtedfaſt to the end of thy life: for as long as any ſenſe of God remains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Soul, thou wilt dread the Not doing of that, which by a ſolemn Promiſe to God thou haſt bound thy ſelf to do; it being in the opinion of all mankind a moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, to falſifie our Vows and Oaths to God, and deſerving the ſevereſt vengeance, that can fall upon the heads of wicked Men.</p>
               <p>§. 3.4. And further, when thou haſt done this, it will not be amiſs to write down thy reſolution, and proteſtation, in the very words thou haſt made it, adding likewiſe the year, and Month, and day, wherein thou didſt thus engage thy ſelf; and to keep it by thee, as a thing of great concernment to thee; and once a Month at leaſt to look ſeriouſly upon it, ſaying to thy heart, <q>See, O my heart, what thou haſt done, obſerve
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48385:44"/>the bond which thou haſt laid upon thy ſelf: it is thy own Act and Deed, there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning it, or excepting againſt it: as ſure as I now ſee it with my eyes, it is recorded before God in Heaven, and it ſhall one day be brought forth againſt me to my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting condemnation, if I do not diſcharge and ſatisfie it: Go on, O my heart, go on, as thou haſt begun, to keep thy reſolution firm, and to pay thy Vows unto the moſt High: and be confident that the Lord will proſper thy good Deſires, and Endeavours, and reward thee according to his gracious Covenant and Promiſe, with everlaſting Glory and Felicity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. All this being done, I think thou may'ſt do well, to make known thy reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the World, as often as fitting occaſions may be offered thee, that is, as often as God may receive honour by it, or thy ſelf be ſecured from temptation or Sin. Such occaſions, in this Age, thou wilt frequently meet with; ſometimes thou wilt fall into the Company of evil men, that diſhonour the Holy Religion which they profeſs, by their wicked and ungodly Lives; and they will not ſpare to reproach thee for not running with them into the ſame exceſſes and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries: then thou may'ſt do well to tell
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48385:45"/>them, <q>That thou art fully reſolved againſt ſuch practices, and that thou did'ſt long ſince take upon thee a profeſſion which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them not, as they have alſo done; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of obedience to the doctrine, and of conformity to the example of the pure and holy Jeſus; and that thou can'ſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out groſs Hypocriſy and inexcuſable Folly act ſo contrary to it as they do.</q> Such a declaration as this, will honour thy Lord and Maſter, and ſhame evil doers; if they be not paſt all ſhame, and all Hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sometimes again, thou wilt meet with men that will play the Devils part, and uſe all their Cunning to perſuade thee to ſome ſinful act: Such men thou muſt let know without delay, <q>That thou art in the full Purpoſe of thy heart, as well as in outward Profeſſion, a Chriſtian; and that thou art reſolved to ſerve thy Lord and Maſter to thy death, and never to do the thing, which thou ſhalt know, will in the leaſt diſpleaſe him: that, how light a matter ſoever others may make it, to diſown him by their works, whom with their Mouths they own and flatter, yet thou eſteemeſt it ſo baſe and ſhameful a thing, that by the help of God's Grace, thou haſt determined never to be guilty of it; and that thou can'ſt not but believe it to be as bad, nay much worſe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48385:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be falſe to God, than to be falſe to men; and that they, who do not think ſo, do moſt unworthily prefer vile duſt and aſhes, before the High and Holy God of Heaven and Earth.</q> This muſt needs ſtop the Mouths of the moſt impudent Tempters; and when thou art known to the World, to be thus well reſolved, thou wilt find a happy freedom from temptations by it. Thy old compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſin (if thou haſt had any) will ceaſe to importune thee, and the Devil, in deſpair of ſucceſs, will ſeldom trouble thee. However, thou wilt diſarme him of one of the moſt dangerous weapons, by which he deſtroys the Soul of Men; nay, thou wilt turn it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, and make that to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of thy ſafety, which might have been the Inſtrument of thy ruine: I mean, the fear of Reproach from wicked Men, (which keeps thouſands in bondage to ſin all their days, going on in their wonted Courſes, not becauſe they approve, or are truly pleas'd with them, but becauſe they are aſhamed to amend them) which Reproach, when thou haſt once couragiouſly contemned by publikely owning thy reſolution, thou wilt make but little account afterwards: for, as a reſolute Soldier, that has paſſed through the hardeſt ſervice againſt the enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wound or Scar, ſeels no Fear within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48385:46"/>of that which remains; ſo it will be with thee, having born the firſt Reproaches of an ungodly World, which are ever the moſ bitter, thou wilt readily contemn and ſet at nought the reſt. The only Fear of Reproach, which will then remain in thee, will be, but that which is juſt, and good, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fear of deſerved Reproach, for not making good that reſolution which thou haſt declared to the World; and the greater thy Fear of this is, the ſafer and the happier thou wilt be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Againſt this part of my advice, I know but one thing that can be objected, <hi>viz.</hi> That in caſe thou ſhouldeſt fail to make good thy Reſolution after this, returning to thy former wickedneſs or careleſneſs, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny penhaps have done after they have purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed well, thou ſhalt bring ſhame upon thy ſelf, and Diſhonour to thy Holy Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And true it is, (my Brother) that theſe will be the effects of thy Failing, and it is as true, that great Care ought to be taken, that nothing be done which will produce ſo great an Evil as either of thoſe. But it is not neceſſary that thou ſhouldeſt fail thus; nay it is not probable, if thou uſeſt that ſincerity, Conſideration, Caution, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection which I have commended to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48385:46"/>thee, becauſe of the ſufficient Grace of God, which will never fail thee: ſo that the force of the objection lies not againſt all reſolving or owning thy reſolution, but againſt doing it raſhly, and unadviſedly, proudly and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly: and it only admoniſheth us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with great deliberation and prudence, and to forbear the publick Owning of it, till we have had ſome proof of our ſincerity towards God, by the Diſcharge of our ſeveral duties, and the reſiſtance of ſome of the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Temptations; eſpecially if we know our ſelves to be of a haſty Temper, and not very conſtant in other things. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured, I doubt not but thou wilt find my advice good; and I did the rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to thee, becauſe of the abounding wickedneſs of the Age; for, though almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man calls himſelf a Chriſtian, and thinks himſelf affronted if he be not ſo eſteemed, yet true Chriſtian Piety is owned by very few, and it is become as diſgraceful, truly to practiſe it, or to plead for it, (more is our miſery) as it is to diſown that good name, which ſhould never be without it; and therefore we take it to be as much our duty now, thus to own the cauſe of it againſt the vile Practices of thoſe, who ſottiſhly reproach and perſecute it, even whil'ſt they call themſelves Chriſtians; as it was of old, the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48385:47"/>duty of Chriſtians to own the Name and profeſſion, againſt the Perſecutions of the Heatheniſh and unbelieving World. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, That Chriſt is as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, by maintaining and defending that real Holineſs, which he came to implant in the Hearts and lives of Men, as he is by the Belief and Acknowledgment of thoſe things which he was pleaſed to do and ſuffer in order to it; and therefore on the other hand, the Denying, the diſſembling, or not owning our obligation to this Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or our reſolution to imbrace, and live in it, when ever we have a juſt cauſe to own it, is as truly Denying of Chriſt, as our proteſting in caſe of danger, that we know him not, or belong not to him, can be thought to be. Be not afraid nor aſhamed, then, to make thy ſelf known to the World to be in the reſolution of thy Heart a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that Chriſt may not be aſhamed of thee before the Angels of God, in that day when all the Secrets of mens hearts ſhall be made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe vile Wretches that live to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of him whoſe name they are called by, and to be Reproach of humane Nature, bluſh not (as thou may'ſt obſerve) to make known the baſeneſs of their Deſigns, and the lewdneſs of their actions; they commit their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48385:47"/>wickedneſs in the ſight of the Sun, and are not aſhamed to boaſt of it when they have done; and ſhouldeſt thou be aſhamed to live worthy of Chriſt, to be truly a Son of God, and to have a deſign upon Glory and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? No, let them be aſhamed that do ſhameful things; but for thee, thy deſign is honourable and worthy of a man, and thy reſolution is becoming a Chriſtian, and it is neceſſary to thee, being one. There is a ſhame, we are told, that ends in death; and ſurely this is that, when men are aſhamed of that which is truly their Glory, and dare not be, what they know they ought to be, becauſe they may be reproached when they are known to be ſo.</p>
               <p>§. 6. There is but one thing more to be added in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That thou wilt do well to ſeek out ſome good men that have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the ſame reſolution, and to acquaint thy ſelf with them, and if poſſible thou can'ſt, to make them thy familiar, and boſome-Friends. Let them know thy Deſign, and Purpoſe of living Holily, and Chriſtianly. Tell them what an Eſteem thou haſt for them, becauſe thou perceiveſt that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to do no leſs: beg their good opinion, and their Love according as they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy ſincerity, and reality in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48385:48"/>thou do'ſt make: deſire their Prayers, their Inſtruction, their reproofs, their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, according as they ſhall ſee thee ſtand in need of them; and that they will look upon thee as a poor and unworthy member of that Holy body, to which they do belong, and of which Chriſt is the head; and that hopes by the mercy of God to be glorified with Chriſt one day, together with them; and that they will therefore have that Regard and tenderneſs for thee, which the members of the ſame body have for one another: and deſire them to accept of the like Regard and Love from thee, and of all the good offices that true Chriſtian Charity can enable thee to do for them. I confeſs it will be no eaſy matter for thee to find ſuch perſons; the number of them is but ſmall, and they are generally no great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, but modeſt and reſerved, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more reſerved, all things conſidered, than they ought to be: for, though the vile Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy of pretenders to Holineſs in this laſt Age, and the dayly Abuſe of its good name by men, that ſeek themſelves in the Ruine of the Church, may ſeem to commend their cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Deſire of being unknown, yet the growth of Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, which thoſe falſe pretenſes have occaſioned, and the danger we are fallen into, of Loſing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48385:48"/>thoſe great advantages for the Practice of Piety, which our Church affords us, does more ſtrongly require them to lay open that Piety which they practiſe in ſecret, and to let the World know, by actions ſuitable to a good profeſſion, That there are ſome, that own the Cauſe of real Holineſs, without Hypocriſy and Guile. And let me tell thee by the way, that if theſe good men of this Church, will thus ſhew themſelves, and unite toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſeveral Parts, of the Kingdom, diſpoſing themſelves into Fraternities, or friendly Societies, and engaging each other in their ſeveral and reſpective Combinations, to be helpful and ſerviceable to one another in all good Chriſtian wayes, it would be the moſt effectual means for reſtoring our decaying Chriſtianity to its Primitive Life and Vigour, and the ſupporting of our tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and ſinking Church. But, not to lead thee too far from the matter I was about; If thou can'ſt find any of theſe good people, I have ſpoken of; I charge thee let thy heart cleave unto them, and let there not be the leaſt ſtrangeneſs, ſo far as lies in thee, between you. Be all as one man, (thus it was with the Primitive Chriſtians <hi>Act.</hi> 2.) and ſo march forward in the good wayes of God againſt all oppoſition, obſerving and <hi>conſidering one another, to provoke unto love and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48385:49"/>to good works, as the Apostle's expreſſions are, Heb.</hi> 10.23. having an Eye continually to the Captain of our Salvation, who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Heaven, in deſpight of all the Powers of darkneſs; and is there preparing a place for us. Thou wilt be no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with theſe good men in Love and Friendſhip, but thou wilt begin to feel the advantages of it. Thou wilt be afraid of no diſcouragements, when thou haſt gotten the aſſiſtance of ſo many true Friends; and thou wilt never fall back from that reſolution, which hath been the occaſion of engaging thee in ſuch good Company. If thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteſt thy ſelf at any time, thou wilt not be without a Remembrancer, and whenever thou faileſt, thou wilt find a reſtorer: and when thou art ſeized with any coldneſs or dulneſs, they will be ready to warm and quicken thee. Theſe are advantages ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that thou can'ſt not prudently ſtick at any pains it may coſt thee to procure them: and therefore let me tell thee for a concluſion of this particular, that if thou can'ſt not be ſo happy as to be acquainted with any of theſe good men, thou muſt do as much as lies in thee, to make ſome of thy old Acquaintance good, by engaging them in the ſame Reſolution, which thou haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up thy ſelf. To which Purpoſe, thou
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48385:49"/>muſt make Uſe of all the knowledge thou haſt of them, and the Intereſt thou haſt in them: tell then what thou art reſolved upon, with the Grounds and Reaſons of thy Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, urge them to conſider and weigh them ſeriouſly, and impartially: if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what thou haſt done, preſs them to do the ſame; if they have ought to object againſt it, anſwer their Objections, and remove their Prejudices: if thou can'ſt not work upon them at one time, try what thou can'ſt do at another, and watch for the fitteſt Seaſons for thy Purpoſe: if one way of diſcourſing will not take effect, try what another way will do, and remember to fit thy ſelf to their Tempers, and diſpoſitions, ſo far as innocently thou may'ſt: If Reaſon will not prevail, try whether Importunity may not, and to all Endeavours with them fail not to add Prayers to God for them: in a word, preſs them with Arguments and Love, and preſs Almighty God with Prayers in their behalf, and be confident, that ſooner or later thou ſhalt ſpeed according to thy hearts deſire. One Perſon thus gained will make thee amends for all thy pains; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, he may prove in a ſhort time as ſerviceable a Friend to thee, as thoſe that entered upon a holy Life before thee, he will be a far greater Comfort to thee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48385:50"/>than any of them: becauſe in all the Good the does, thou wilt have ſome kind of Share, and every ſtep he takes in thoſe good wayes thou haſt brought him to, will be as a new Pledge to aſſure thee of thy future Glory; there being no greater Promiſes made to any, than to thoſe <hi>who turn to righteouſneſs, from the error of their wayes;</hi> ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>v.</hi> But enough hath been ſaid of Framing and Fixing thy Reſolution, and the things which I can conceive to be requiſite for the making it firm and effectual. It is now time that I direct thee how to put it in practice, and therefore.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> Containing the ſecond Advice, <hi>To take up our Croſs and forſake all to follow Chriſt;</hi> wherein is explained the Nature of this duty, and the neceſſity of it. <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Containing ſeveral Arguments to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to this duty of Self-Denial, from the neceſſity of it, in Order to our ſpiritual Life and Health, from the example of our Saviour, who was a great Pattern of Self-Denial; from the reaſonableneſs of this Duty conſidered in it ſelf, and the great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it. <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Containing ſome Directions how to put this Duty of Self-Denial in practice.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>THou muſt deny thy ſelf, take up thy Croſs, and forſake all.</hi> This is the firſt thing that is to be done by thoſe that are reſolved upon a Holy and Chriſtian Life; and it is ſo neceſſary to be done in the firſt place, that if thou faileſt in it, it will be a vain thing for me to offer thee any further direction. Now, it ſo much concerns thee
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48385:51"/>to be fully perſuaded of this truth, that thou muſt give me Leave to ſhew thee, that I tell thee no more in this caſe, and give no other Advice, than what our bleſſed Lord and Maſter hath done: ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>He ſaid to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, take up his Croſs daily, and follow me; for whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, but whoſoever will loſe it for my ſake, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which words, is plainly this, all that will be Chriſtians indeed, muſt deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, take up their Croſs, and follow Chriſt, and not reſerve ſo much as their very Lives, but be willing and ready to reſign up all for him. But leſt we ſhould imagine this to concerne ſome choice perſons only, whom he deſigned to bring to greater perfection than others are obliged to aim at, ſuch as his Apoſtles may be thought to be, he was pleaſed to ſpeak as much, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, to the multitudes that followed him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 25, 26, 27. <hi>v. There were great multitudes with him, and he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſaid unto them, if any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, yea and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple; and whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs and come after me, cannot be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48385:51"/>that is, he that will not deny, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake (as we are wont to do thoſe things we hate) whatſoever is dear to him in the World, be it Father and Mother, or Wife and Children, or Brethren and Siſters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Chriſt before them all, and is not fully reſolved and prepared to ſuffer any thing, how hard ſoever, for Chriſt's ſake, cannot be a Diſciple of Chriſt, or a true Chriſtian. The Word <hi>[Cannot]</hi> ſignifies ſuch an Impoſſibility, as implies a Contradiction; to deny our ſelves, and all our deareſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts in this World, is eſſential to the ſincere profeſſion of Chriſtanity, and therefore he, who will not do this, cannot be a Chriſtian. Thoſe dear things which he cannot renounce, will not ſuffer him to take this profeſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or if he do take it upon him, they will in time cauſe him to repent his Undertaking, and to fall away with ſhame from it. And then in the words following, he adviſes them to conſider ſeriouſly what they are about to do, before they took upon them to be his Diſciples; and that his Advice might ſink more deeply into their minds, he expreſſes himſelf in two Parables (which I have before mentioned) <hi>viz. of a man intending to build a Tower, and ſitting down first to conſider the Coſt; and of a King going to make War againſt another King, and conſidering firſt his abilities
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48385:52"/>to go through with it:</hi> And then he concludes <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>So likewiſe, whoſoever he be of you, that for ſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Which concluſion makes it a plain caſe, That we cannot wiſely nor ſafely engage our ſelves to Chriſt, or liſt our ſelves as Soldiers under his Banner, till we have denyed, renounced, given up all Intereſt in our ſelves, and whatſoever is dear unto us. Not thus prepared, we do but exaſperate and provoke an Enemy, our old Enemie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, whoſe Forces we ſhall not be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and ſo lay foundation for our future Shame and Ruin; and though at firſt reading, we may think thoſe Compariſons but ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, for what agreement is there between having Riches and Armies, and forſaking all that we have? yet upon ſecond thoughts, we may perceive a very wiſe Deſign in it. For Chriſtianity is a ſpiritual Warfare, and ſome of the moſt Powerful Enemies we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, are, the Riches and Pleaſures and Honours of this World, and therefore the ſtrength and courage of a Chriſtian Soldier, whereby he will obtain a glorious Victory, conſiſts in Self-Denyal, and a contempt of this World; and a Chriſtian is God's Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſpiritual Houſe, the Temple of God, and the very foundation of this Building is laid in Humility and Self-Denyal, from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48385:52"/>whence proceed all thoſe Divine Graces and Virtues, which both perfect &amp; adorn the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which make Humility and Poverty of Spirit, Renouncing the Love of this World, and the very Poſſeſſion of it, too, in ſome caſes, as neceſſary to our becoming Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as a great deal of money is to erect and perfect a ſtately and magnificent Building. This appears to be a great truth, and no groundleſs Fancy, by the Parable of the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Supper in the former part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which thou may'ſt do well to reflect upon. The Maſter ſent his ſervants to call them that were bidden, when his Supper was ready; but they all refuſed, and deſired to be excuſed: one had bought a piece of ground, and he muſt go and ſee it; another had bought five yoke of Oxen, and he muſt go and prove them; and another had married a Wife, and he could not come: but when he ſent his Servants to call the Poor, the Blind, and the Lame, they came in immediately; ſo that the poor and miſerable people of the World, that have no Worldly thing to truſt to, or thoſe who have theſe things, but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Love of them, are better diſpoſed to receive the Goſpel, and to become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, than the Rich and the Great that have the World at will, as we ſay, and wallow in the Pleaſures thereof. We have a very
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48385:53"/>remarkable Inſtance of the Miſchief that wordly Riches do to thoſe that both have and love them, in the <hi>10th Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel, and the 17, and 18. <hi>v.</hi> &amp;c. and there are ſeveral things in the <hi>Chapter,</hi> relating to it, that deſerve our Regard. In the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before, we find our bleſſed Saviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with his Diſciples for forbidding little children to be brought unto him, and ſaying to them <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God;</hi> that is, their Innocency and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, their willingneſs to be guided and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by others, makes them the ſitteſt Emblems of thoſe that do truly belong to my Chruch, and Kingdom. And then he adds, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he ſhall not enter therein,</hi> that is, he that takes not the Chriſtian profeſſion upon him, as a little child, that is, with that very Humility, Diſintereſſedneſs, Self-Denyal &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, as is remarkable in little children, will never ſubmit to thoſe lawes which I give to the World, and ſhall never be received by me as a Chriſtian. Now immediately upon this, as if Divine Providence had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it for a confirmation of this truth there came a young man to Chriſt, upon a very weighty and important buſineſs; this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48385:53"/>young man's heart was in a good meaſure ſet upon eternal life, and he had entertained a great opinion of Chriſt, as appeared by the haſt he made, by the humility of his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the words he uſed to him. <hi>He came running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, ſaying, Good Maſter what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> he had done much in order to it before, <hi>he had kept the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from his youth up;</hi> ſo he profeſſed, and there is no Doubt but he ſpake what he thought, and what he had done in a good meaſure. for it is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>That Jeſus loved him,</hi> that is, he approved of his good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and deſired that they might be perfected: but when he tole him, that there was one things ſtill wanting, <hi>viz. that he muſt go and ſell all, and give to the Poor, and take up his Croſs and follow him;</hi> the forward young man diſlike his Counſel, <hi>became ſad, and went away</hi> grieved; and why? <hi>becauſe he had great poſſeſſions;</hi> he had them, and he loved them likewiſe; and who can blame him for being ſad, when he was told, That either he muſt loſe Eternal life, or part with them? He had not got his Riches by fraud and deceit, by violence and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as many among us have done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to keep them, and yet hope for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, (for ſo he had not kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48385:54"/>which Chriſt ſpake to him of,) his Love to the World had not prevailed ſo far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as to draw him to ſuch wickedneſs, but his fault was; that he had ſo great a Love to his Riches, that he could not find in his heart to part with them, no not for the Obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Everlaſting life. Had he been as a little child, and had valued them no more than a child would have done, he had obtained his deſire, and had entred into the Kingdom of God: But, becauſe it was not thus with him, his good meanings miſcarried, and he fell ſhort of that happineſs which he ſought after. Thus was this unhappy man a ſad Inſtance of the truth of our bleſſed Saviours words; and ſo the Diſciples looked upon him, being aſtoniſhed at the bewitching power of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſions; (for it is not improbable, that this might be one cauſe of their wonder, as well as the words of their Maſter upon this accident, for though his firſt words, <hi>how hardly ſhall thoſe that have Riches enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> might have aſtoniſhed them another time, yet his ſecond words, <hi>How hard is it for them that truſt in Riches to enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> would have removed their aſtoniſhment; it being eaſy for them to apprehend, that thoſe that truſt in Riches will not truſt in God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not be ſaved by him,) but they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48385:54"/>were aſtoniſhed to ſee a man that meant ſo well, and was come ſo near to the Kingdom of God, overthrown by his great poſſeſſions; and ſince Riches had ſo great a Power over him, and could turn him back from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, they believed, they would turn all the rich men in the World from it; if he, after having kept the Commandements from his youth up, did truſt in his Riches, no Rich man could be found, they thought, that they did not truſt in them; and therefore ſaid among themſelves, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> and though <hi>Peter</hi> immediately expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome hope of his Salvation, and the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his fellow-Diſciples, becauſe they had left all, and followed him; yet it appears from what follows in the <hi>Chapter</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 35. that he was deceived in his opinion of what they had done; for, though they had left their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to follow him, yet there was ſomething of Selfiſhneſs ſtill remaining in them, and to be renounced by them; they had too great an opinion of the Worlds grandure, and they aimed at it more than they were to do; and this their Maſter was very well aware of, and therefore he tells them in another place, [<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.23.] (when they had propoſed a Queſtion to him which diſcovered the Inclinations of their hearts, asking him, <hi>who was the greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>) That <hi>except they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48385:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>were converted and became as little Children,</hi> that is, as unconcerned for that greatneſs which they thought of, as little children are, <hi>They ſhould not enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> They were converted in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then, and had given a good evidence of it, by quitting their poſſeſſions for their Maſter's ſake: but it ſeems there was ſtill ſomething to be done: they were not ſo eſtranged from the World, nor ſo reſigned as to all fleſhly Intereſt, but they needed to be put in mind, that they muſt deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more intirely, <hi>and become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> then would they be fit for that ſervice he deſigned to put them upon, and not till then. And thus indeed it was with them, for, whil'ſt their heads were poſſeſt with Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that their Maſter was to be a mighty temporal Prince, and their Souls were hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Glories which they imagined they ſhould partake of with him, they were often offended with his diſcourſe, and when they ſaw him in the hands of his enemies and began to ſuſpect the Ruine of their hopes and expectations, they ſhamefully deſerted him. Thus in the <hi>8th</hi> chap. of St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Goſpel, when he began to tell them, <hi>That he muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of the chief Priests and Elders and Scribes, and he put to death,</hi> Peter <hi>took him and rebuked
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48385:55"/>him, v.</hi> 32. And when thoſe things were coming upon him, which he ſpake of, <hi>They all forſook him and fled,</hi> as we read <hi>Mark</hi> 14.50. <hi>v.</hi> but then afterwards, when their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes were rectified, and their Souls more perfectly purged from the Love of earthly things, by the deſcent of the Holy Spirit upon them, every word that their Maſter had ſpoken to them, and which the Spirit brought to their Remembrance, was dear unto them, and they were not afraid nor aſhamed to confeſs him before their greateſt enemies. Then, the Croſs of Chriſt was their greateſt Glory; and to be made like to him in ſuffering, and patience, and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God, was the great Deſire, and Joy of their Hearts. Then they could call upon men to deny themſelves, and forſake all, as earneſtly, as their Maſter had done before them; for what elſe do thoſe repeated exhortations ſignify, <hi>of not living to our ſelves; of dying to our Sins; of being crucified to the World; of being crucified, dead and buried with Christ; of offering ourſelves Sacrifices to God,</hi> and many more the like, which we read in their Epiſtles? and indeed they did it very effectually, whil'ſt their doctrine and Practice went Hand in Hand together; for, in ſpight of the wickedneſs of the World, and the ſubtile malice of the Devil, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48385:56"/>in all places, and filled every corner of the World with Wonders of Self-Denyal, and Patience, and Contempt of the World; with men that could take <hi>joyfully the ſpoyling of their Goods,</hi> as we read <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 34. And that counted not their Lives dear for Chriſt's ſake, and the Goſpels. And ſuch Self-Denying men were Chriſtians generally in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity: <q>Witneſs <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> who ſpeaking of thoſe of his time, tels us. We are not moved with the loſs of our Eſtates, which our enemies wreſt from us, nor with the violence that is offered to our Credit and Reputation, or if there be any thing of greater concernment than theſe; for, although theſe things are mightily prized and valued amongſt men, yet can we deſpiſe and ſlight them; nay, we cannot only when beaten refrain from ſtriking again, and make no reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that invade and ſpoyl us; but to thoſe that ſmite one cheek, we can turn the other, and to them that take away the coat, we can let go the cloak alſo.</q> Thus did the Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians deny themſelves, and forſake all; and are not we bound to do ſo likewiſe, thinkeſt thou? may we be his Diſciples upon eaſier terms than they were? has he made the way to Heaven broader than it was, and given us allowances which he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48385:56"/>vouchſafed not to them of former Ages no certainly. It is true, we are not altoge ther in the ſame circumſtances as they were in, for, the Chriſtian profeſſion (though now honourable among us) was then ſo vile a thing in the eyes of the World, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hated, that none could take it up, and own it publikely, without hazarding the loſs of all they had; and therefore, if any were ſo raſh as to take it up, before they had denyed themſelves, they quickly diſcovered their raſhneſs and want of Self-Denyal, by falling away from it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be granted, that Self-Denyal is not now ſo neceſſary, as to the Taking up and Retaining the bare profeſſion of Chriſtianity as it was of old: but then, as to the Practice of it, it is certainly as neceſſary as ever it was; and though the Profeſſion be honoured at preſent, yet the Practice is as much deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the making good of what we do profeſs in a pure and Holy Life, will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly expoſe a Man to as many Evils (God be thanked, that I cannot ſay to death) as the Profeſſion of old was wont to do; and therefore, he that will ſatisfy that name which he hath taken upon him, and obſerve the Profeſſion which he hath made in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, muſt be brought to that Frame and Temper of Mind, which thoſe good men in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48385:57"/>the beginning of Chriſtianity were brought to, that is, he muſt be taken off from himſelf, from all ſelf-intereſts, and ſelf-ſatisfactions, he muſt renounce all propriety in himſelf and every thing elſe, be dead to the World, have no more affection to the worldly things, than the dead have; that ſo nothing may hinder him from living unto God. There are but few indeed that ſeriouſly conſider this, and therefore we ſee, that men generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves Chriſtians from their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and as long as they do not renounce their Baptiſme, they are confident that they are ſo: but he that hath told us, <hi>that many are called,</hi> that is, to be Chriſtians; but <hi>few are choſen,</hi> that is, will approve themſelves to be ſo, makes another judgment of them; and they will know it one day to their Shame and Sorrow. They have fallen by God's good providence upon that which is in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among us, and they ſee at preſent no Reaſon why they ſhould caſt it off, I mean, the outward Profeſſion of Chriſtianity: but as for that which is not faſhionable and in Credit, that is, the Denying of our ſelves, and Dying to the World, they never underſtood it; and becauſe they do not deny themſelves, and dye to the World, they cannot live to God.</p>
               <p>This might ſuffice, my Brother, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee, that thou muſt deny thy ſelf, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48385:57"/>forſake all, if thou deſireſt to live a holy and Chriſtian Life. But becauſe I know mens backwardneſs to entertain this hard Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they are apt to term it, and becauſe I know that it is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that thoſe who will live a Chriſtian Life, do both believe, and practiſs it; I ſhall ſhew thee yet further, that the Not-conſidering, or the Nor-practiſing this Self-Denyal, hath been the main cauſe, why ſo many have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Goſpel in all Ages, and why ſo many of theſe that have ſeemed to receive it, have yielded ſo lame and ſo imperfect an obedience to it. Did'ſt thou never read in thy Bible, how few of thoſe that heard Chriſt preach whil'ſt he was upon the earth, and ſaw the Miracles that he wrought, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the greater ſort, did truly believe in him? <hi>Have any of the Rulers or of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees believed on him,</hi> was a choaking Queſtion to any that would dare to ſpeak for him, <hi>John</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 48. <hi>v.</hi> Thoſe few Diſciples that he had, were of the poorer ſort of people, that had not much to truſt to, or much to loſe for his ſake; if any of hte richer or greater ſort were convinced, that He was the Chriſt, yet they did not dare to own it, they would go by night, and in ſecret to tell him of their Faith; but publikly and openly they profeſſed it not: and what might be the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48385:58"/>Reaſon of this, do'ſt thou think? Had not theſe great men thoſe natural Powers of judging, of aſſenting and conſenting to the truth, which the others had? was not their natural courage as great, and woul they not have ſhewed it as much in other Caſes, as theſe poor people could have done? Yes undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. In all other matters they were the wiſe, thoſe the ignorant, they the bold and the hardy, thoſe the poor ſpirited and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly: but in this caſe the wiſe were fools, and the couragious meer Daſtards. And how was this? thoſe great, thoſe rich and proud men could not, or would not learn this one leſſon, which would have opened their blind eyes, and have raiſed their poor Spirits, to that degree of Boldneſs, which they beheld in the Diſciples of Chriſt, and wondered at: <hi>How can ye believe</hi> (ſaid Chriſt himſelf to them) <hi>as long as ye receive Honour from one another, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God only, John</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 44. <hi>v.?</hi> They loved themſelves, and the Praiſe of men too well, to approve of any thing that would leſſen their Reputation in the leaſt, or bring them one ſtep lower in the Eſteem of the World: and they were too covetous, as appears from other places of Scripture, to leave all, to follow one that had not a houſe to put his-head in. Did'ſt thou never
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48385:58"/>obſerve the monſtrous unbelief of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and the groſs Hypocriſy of others? did'ſt thou never obſerve, what great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made by ſome men, againſt ſome of the cleareſt truths of Chriſtianity, who yet ſeem very fond of other truths, that are not ſo clear, and lye not ſo level to humane capacities? and did'ſt thou never take notice, how ſtrict ſome men are in ſome things, who yet allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the breach of very plain and very weighty precepts? as for Inſtance, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity we ſee unanimouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by many thouſands among us, when the Divine authority of Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the Right of their maintenance meets with many oppoſers in all places: and ſome men can preach and pray from morning till night, and talk Scripture to each other with much ſeeming ſeriouſneſs, when like the Phariſees of old they will embrace any fair occaſion that is offered to devour the Houſe of a poor Widow or Orphan, or to exalt themſelves ſomewhat higher in the World; And what do'ſt thou think is the Reaſon of theſe things? The ſame without doubt, that hindred the Jews of old from receiving Chriſt: and if theſe truths which they profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and theſe Chriſtian duties which they are conſtant in, did as much oppoſe their worldly Intereſts, and fleſhly Luſts, as the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48385:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Jeſus to be the Chriſt, did oppoſe the Intereſts and Luſts of the unbelieving Jews, they would quickly diſcover the truth of it, by falling away from thoſe truths and thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, if not alſo from the whole Religion. Not that I believe, that they have been meer diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers from their firſt profeſſion, or that they are, and have been ſo zealous in ſome things meerly for the compaſſing of worldly Ends, without any conviction of the truth or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, (for I doubt not but many of them have meant well from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) but, That naughty and corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which being unrenounced, did ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally prejudice the Jews againſt the Perſon of Chriſt, do as ſtrongly prejudice them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt great part of his doctrine. Thoſe corrupt affections which they ſhould have renounced at their firſt ſetting out, are like a thick cloud upon the eyes of their minds, not ſuffering them to diſcern thoſe truths, which to reſigned men are as manifeſt as the Sun at noon-day, and as a ſtrong byaſs upon their Wills, drawing them aſide from thoſe good paths, which they have a deſire to walk in. They purpoſe well in the general, like the Rich man before ſpoken of, when he came to Chriſt, and they do well in thoſe things that oppoſe not their inordinate affections; but when they are to learn thoſe Duties,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48385:59"/>to which their Luſts will not be reconciled, either they are not able to underſtand them, or have not the Power to practiſe them; as the Wolf in the Fable, that was ſet to ſchool to read, could make no word of all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but a Lamb, becauſe of his appetite to the fleſh of that harmleſs Creature; ſo they can underſtand, approve, and follow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they love, and are inclined to, or however nothing that croſſes their Affections and Inclinations. I will conclude therefore (and I think I have good reaſon for it) that if we deſire and are reſolved to be Chriſtians, we muſt in the firſt place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our ſelves, and entirely put off our carnal Luſts and Worldly affections: Our Deſires and Reſolutions will be vain and come to nought, if we fail to Do it. We may purpoſe well, and perhaps do many good things, though we do omit it; we may make a fair Show for a while, and mount up to Heaven in our own thoughts, and in the opinion of the World; but, like as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Builder, that raiſes a very fair ſtructure upwards, not having laid a good and firm foundation, will in a little time be convinced of this error, by its ruine; ſo when a time of tryal and temptation comes, our own Fall will ſhew us ours: when the Winds blow, and Rains fall, and the Floods come, our pretty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48385:60"/>Frame of Religion will come to Ruine, and our high raiſed hopes will periſh together with it. Now after this, I ſuppoſe, I need not tell thee that I have inſiſted ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Particular with great Reaſon.</p>
               <p>§. 2. It remains, That I endeavour briefly to beget a good opinion in thee of the duty I have been ſpeaking of; to ſhew thee, that it is not ſuch an unreaſonable thing as ſome men fancy it, to be obliged to it, and that Chriſt cannot reaſonably be thought a hard Maſter for laying it upon us. For, ſurely</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that hath laid nothing upon us, but what our State and Condition, and his own Deſign of Love and mercy towards us, did make neceſſary, cannot be judged hard or cruel to us; and hath Chriſt required any thing more in this matter? No undoubtedly; he could not give us health and life (how much ſoever he deſired it) without remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Diſeaſes: he could not be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Salvation to us, without taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which was our Ruine and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And what was our Diſeaſe and Ruine. but an inordinate and immoderate Love of our ſelves, and our fellow-Creatures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we fell away from God, to be as Gods our ſelves, to pleaſe our ſelves, to provide for our ſelves, to do our own Wills, and to ſatisfy our own Deſires without reſtraint or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48385:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>comptrol? Now, what is it that we would have, when we quarrel with Chriſt, and call this Commandement grievous? would we have our health and our deſires too? would we live and dye alſo? would we ſerve God a little, and our ſelves much more? or would we ſerve him ſo far only, as we ſhall pleaſe our ſelves, and have that be taken for all the ſervice that we own him? If thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt this to be unreaſonable, as thou canſt not but doe, thou muſt needs acknowledg it to be neceſſary that thou ſhouldeſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from thy ſelf, and all worldly things, that thou mighteſt ſerve thy God. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
               <p n="2">2. We cannot reaſonably look upon him as a hard Maſter, who ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that which he has impoſed upon us, being himſelf the greateſt example of Self-denial, and Forſaking all, that ever was. What thinkeſt thou of his Appearing in our frail fleſh, of his low eſtate in the World, of his Pain and Travail, of his Thorny Crown and Croſs? Was there not Self-denial in all this, and ſuch as Angels and men may juſtly wonder and be aſtoniſhed at for ever? He, <hi>who being in the form of God, thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of a man,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48385:61"/>and being found in faſhion as a man, humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs. Phil.</hi> 2, 6, 7, 8. He, who might have commanded all the riches, and glory of the World, as being Lord of all, <hi>became poor, that by his poverty we might be made rich,</hi> 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.9. He, who made all mankind to ſerve and pleaſe him, <hi>Pleaſed not himſelf,</hi> but became a ſervant for our Good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 3. He, who could have had more than twelve <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Angels for his Guard Math.</hi> 26, 53. yeilded his cheeks to be ſmitten, his Face to be ſpit upon, his back to be ſcourged, his hands and feet to be nailed to an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tree, and his ſide and heart to be pierced by the Vileſt Sinners, whom with one word of his mouth he might have turn'd into Hell. Thus did our great and good Maſter deny himſelf, and forſake all: and can we poor worthleſs wretches think it much to deny our Vile ſelves, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe little things, which we call our own, for his ſake, and in obedience to his command? had he dealt with us, as thoſe that once Sate in Moſes's Chair did with their Diſciples, <hi>laying heavy burdens upon them, and grievous to be born, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would not touch with one of their fingers Math.</hi> 23, 4. we might have had ſome
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48385:61"/>ſeeming cauſe of complaint: but, ſince he himſelf hath born the burden, which he hath layd upon us, yea, and a far greater, we are moſt unreaſonable people, if we do open our mouths againſt him: he is too ſoft and delicate a ſervant ſurely that would fare better than his Lord, or be exempted from that work, which his Lord diſdaineth not to put his hand unto. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. I beſeech thee, Brother, tell me what it is which thou Judgeſt hard and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in this Commandment. Is it that we ſhould believe our ſelves to be what we really are, and that we ſhould demean our ſelves in the World accordingly? Is that we who do own our ſelves to be nothing of our ſelves, and to have nothing of our ſelves, ſhould be as nothing to our ſelves, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no propriety in our Selves, but in Subordination to him of whom we are, and from whom we have received all? Is it that he who hath made us for himſelf, and without any other motive than that was in himſelf, and who hath freely given us all we do poſſeſs, will diſpoſe of us and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Pleaſure? Is it that we ſhould prefer him before our ſelves and his Will before our own, and be ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with all that he hath given us, when ever he is pleaſed to call for it? Is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48385:62"/>it that we ſhould be content to receive Evil from him as well as Good, when he ſhall ſee it fit for his own Glory and our greater Good? I dare ſay that there is nothing in all this, that thou wilt except againſt; and this is all that is required of thee. But yet further;</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe it appear after all, that what is here required, is not only juſt and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but hugely Profitable, and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for us; may we not juſtly look upon them to be very unreaſonable, that do quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with it? And truly thus it is and thus it will appear to be, upon very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; It is no ſmall advantage, to be at liberty to Obey God entirely, and to be able to doe it, with eaſe, with delight and pleaſure: it is no little benefit to be out of the Reach of the Devils malice, and of all thoſe Dangerous weapons wherewith he aſſaults and deſtroys poor Souls. And this we ſhall Infallibly obtain by the practice and performance of this one Duty. For what is it, that indiſpoſes us to the ſervice of God, that makes his Righteous &amp; Holy Laws to be grievous and uneaſy to us, but our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon us to be ſomething of our ſelves, and to diſpoſe of our ſelves according to our own wills? What is it that gives the Devil ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48385:62"/>much advantage over us, but our diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſions and affections? and whence have all his Temptations their Force and Power, and all his Artifices their Succeſs, but from our inordinate Love of our ſelves and theſe Worldly things? And therefore when we have put off this Love, and baniſhed theſe things our hearts, as we are taught to do, we have Diſarmed our Enemy, or taken off the edge of all his weapons; we have baffled his accurſed policies, and ſecured our ſelves from his Devices. Men may talk of riches, and honours and fleſhly pleaſures, as long as they pleaſe, to thoſe that are dead; and they may threaten them with reproaches and pains, and other evil things, till they have wearied themſelves, and not find Them moved in the leaſt with it: and no leſs unmoveable ſhall we be, to all the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Devil, if we be but perfectly mortified and reſigned. Theſe are great advantages; but there is yet one more, no leſs conſiderable in the eſteem of ſome men, viz. that this will raiſe us up above all the Troubles, perplexities and ſorrows of this miſerable World, ſo that let what will come upon us here, it ſhall never be able to hurt us. For whence have all the evil things of the World (as we are wont to call them) their Sting and edge, but from our unrenounced
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48385:63"/>ſelves, our unmortified luſts and paſſions? we will be ſomething, we will do every thing, and every thing muſt be as we will have it; but in the event we find we are nothing, and that we can do ntohing, and the ſtubborn things will not comply with with us; and therefore we are troubled, we are in pain, we are overwhelmed with grief and ſorrow. This is an Evil that hath no Remedy but Self-Denial, and reſignation to God; and this is a Remedy that never fails. When we have put off our ſelves, as we ought, and diſengaged our affections from all earthly things, and can give God leave to diſpoſe of his own Creatures, and to govern his own World: then weſhall be in Peace, then we ſhall be happy, and not till then; then nothing can go againſt us, becauſe we ſhall be willing to comply with every thing. By this time I hope I have perfectly reconciled thee to this Duty, and that thou art reſolved to put it in Practice. It remains now that I ſhew thee, as briefly as may be, how to do it. And,</p>
               <p>§. 3. Becauſe thou wilt certainly meet with many and great difficulties in thy firſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and the difficulties will be the more and the greater, by how much the more thou haſt loved thy Self, and the World formerly, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48385:63"/>haſt been accuſtomed to pleaſe thy ſelf, and to indulge thy affections; it willb e neceſſary,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That thou enter upon the Practice of it, with the ſtrongeſt convictions that poſſibly can be, both of the neceſſity, and reaſonableneſs of it: and that thou arm thy ſelf with ſuch conſiderations as may beat down all oppoſitiion, and effectually encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee againſt all the difficulties thou can'ſt encounter with. To this purpoſe thou may'ſt make Uſe of all that I have already ſaid, and of many other things, which my Deſign will not permit me to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. And after this manner may'ſt thou diſcourſe with thy own heart concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: <q>I am told, That I muſt deny my ſelf, and forſake the World, and take up my Croſs, if I will be a true Chriſtian: I am told it by Chriſt himſelf, and if I do not believe him, why do I call him my Lord, and profeſs to truſt in him as my Saviour? I know that his words have been ocnfirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are confirmed dayly by a thouſand Inſtances: nay, I my ſelf am an unhappy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the truth of them, having made but little progreſs in Chriſtian knowledge, and leſs in Chriſtian vertue, meerly for Want of a ſerious Regard unto them. But if I do believe them, why do I not practiſe accordingly? Does not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48385:64"/>my everlaſting happineſs depend upon my being a Chriſtian indeed; and can I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſtick at any thing that is needful for the ſecuring my ſelf of that? Is it fit that ſuch a poor derivative thing as I am, ſhould take upon me to be abſolute and independent? What have I done for my ſelf heretofore, and what can I do for my ſelf hereafter, that I ſhould prefume to pleaſe my ſelf, or ſeek my ſelf in any thing? I cannot add one Inch to my Stature, I cannot make one hair white or black, I cannot do my ſelf the leaſt Good, nor remove from my ſelf the lighteſt Evil; and ſhall I take upon me to do my own Will without reſpect to him, by whom alone I am, and without whoſe influence and Bleſſing I can do nothing? And what is the World that I ſhould ſet my heart upon it, and prefer it before my God and Saviour? did my Love of it ever do me any Good; or will it do me any without God's Bleſſing, or when I am to leave it that I ſhould cleave at preſent ſo cloſe unto it? I know that it is God alone that give me any portion in it, that gives me any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by it, and I Know that he can deprive me of both, when he pleaſes; And there fore I ſhall be, not only a Rebel, but a fool if I reſign not my ſelf and it to him, and ſay not, whatever is laid upon me <hi>It is the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48385:64"/>Lord, let him do whatſoever ſeemeth good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi> Come therefore, O my heart, let us be no longer Rebels againſt Heaven, and enemies to our own Happineſs: we are not our own, we are not the Worl's, but we are God's, we are Chriſt's, and therefore let God diſpoſe of us as he will, and let him give thoſe worldly things to whom he pleaſes, ſo that we may have his favour, and enjoy it for ever. O naughty ſelf! how do I deteſt thee, for taking ſo mcuh upon thee, as thou haſt done hitherto? O vain, O tranſitory World! I abhor thee, I renounce thee utterly: court me no more with thy ſottiſh Pleaſures, withthly glittering bravery, with thy deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shows; I am now dying, and I will be for ever dead unto thee, that I may follow Chriſt, and live unto my God. Favour theſe good deſires, favour them with thy Grace, O my god, and ſuffer not a Soul, that earneſtly aſpires towards thee, to fall ſhort of thee.</q> With theſe and ſuch like thoughts, thou wilt do well to enter upon the Practice of this duty. But then, I adviſe thee,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To do as much as thou can'ſt, to keep theſe and the like thoughts continually in thy mind. However, ſail not to begin eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day with them. When thou firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeſt the light in the morning, after thou
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48385:65"/>haſt ſent up thy heart to God in ſome ſhort acknowledgements of his mercy towards thee, tell thy heart, That thou haſt by God's goodneſs another dayadded to thy life, which thou muſt imploy for him and his ſervice, who hath beſtowed it on thee, and not for the pleaſing of thy ſelf and the ſatisfying of thy Luſts; and charge it, as it will anſwer for it at the great day, that it take care to do it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. The like thoughts and reſolutions will do well again about noon, and indeed at any time of the day, and the oftner they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into thy mind, the more eaſily and ſpeedily wilt thou come to that perfect reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which thou art concerned to aim at. But yet further,</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will behove thee to be frequent in Exerciſes of Mortification and Self-Denyal. Reſtrain thy wonted Liberties, and deny thy ſelf thy accuſtomed Satisfactions; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſelf ſometimes with hardſhips, and turn not alwayes away from ſufferings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that thou art a Soldier under the Enſign of the Croſs, and therefore muſt not be nice and tender, ſoft and delicate. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy Senſes, and accuſtome them to thoſe things that are leaſt agreeable, knowing that there are ſome offices to be done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a Chriſtian, ſuch as viſiting poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and dreſſing of poor peoples Sores, &amp;c.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48385:65"/>Which men of a nice and ſqueamiſh ſenſe will hardly be perſuaded to perform. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify thy paſſions likewiſe, and keep them ſtrictly within their bounds; for as he is a beaſt that is a ſlave to Senſe, ſo is he a Fool that is governed by his Paſſions. In one word, conſider thy ſelf well, mark thy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, thy Inclinations and affections, and keep thy ſelf and them under conſtant diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and correction. Haſt thou a trifling wanton ſpirit? art thou much delighted with the Ralleries, Drolleries, Sportings and Jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of wanton Fancies and looſe tongues? fail not, I beſeech thee, to reſtrain thy incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; avoid the company of light and vain perſons, and turn away thy thoughts from trivial matters, to the concernments of a Soul that muſt ſhortly appear before the Bar of a juſt and holy God; remembring that the Maſter whom thou profeſſeſt to ſerve, was a ſerious, grave, and uſeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not a Buffoon, or Stage-player. It was the grief of a devout man many years agone [St. <hi>Bernard</hi>] to obſerve the lightneſs, laughter, and ſecurity of many Chriſtians, and his continual fear that he ſhould ſee them forſaken of the Divine Grace, of which they ſhewed themſelves to be unmindful. What Grief, what Fear, do'ſt thou think, would have poſſeſſed his heart, if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48385:66"/>in this Age, and had been a witneſs of our vanity in this kind? we live in a merry World at preſent, and nothing is ſacred or weighty enough to eſcape our Sportings: but believe it, God will ſhortly ſpoil our vain mirth, and make us ſerious whether we will or not. Art thou ſoft &amp; ſlothful, inclined to ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and voluptuouſneſs? rouſe up thy ſelf, and be alwayes doing, take up with coarſe Fare, faſt often, lye hard, go frequently to the houſe of Mourning, and keep him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thine Eye, who, after a life of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued travel in doing Good, had no eaſier a bed than a Croſs to reſt upon. Do the Riches of the World pleaſe thee? refuſe them when they are offered, or let the hand of liberality immediately diſtribute them, to thoſe that want them; and keep in mind thoſe good men, whom thy Bible tells thee of, who, though they could have enriched themſelves by miracles, yet continued poor, and had not ſo much as an houſe to put their heads in. Do wordly Honours tickle thee, and the Applauſes of men delight thee? Retire from publick employments, and hide thy ſelf in the meanneſs and obſcurity of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-life; be exact and open in the Practice of thoſe Virtues which are moſt unfaſhionable, and which the generallity of men have a mean opinion of; and forget not, That there
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48385:66"/>was a perſon once in the World, who was able to have governed the whole World, that lead the greateſt part of his Life in the Countrey-Villages, and among poor people, and would not have his great and mighty works to be publickly ſpoken of. This is to practiſe Self-Denyal; and by theſe and the like Practices, thou wilt in a ſhort time arrive at that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſignation, to which I deſire to lead thee. But then in the laſt place,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be ſure, That in theſe Practices, and in whatever elſe thou do'ſt, thou take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thy ſelf; but refer thy ſelf and all to Almighty God. Thou may'ſt begin well, my Brother, <hi>viz.</hi> in renouncing thy ſelf, and yet may'ſt end ill, <hi>viz.</hi> in that very ſelf, which thou did'ſt at firſt renounce: and this thou do'ſt, if thou do'ſt do theſe things for the ſatisfaction of thy ſelf, and ſeekeſt thy own Glory in them. Forget not therefore this laſt advice; 'tis not for thy ſelf, but for God, that thou muſt be thus imployed; that thou may'ſt be entirely reſigned to God, and be for ever united with God. Thou muſt be as nothing to thy ſelf, and the World muſt be as nothing to thee, that God may be all in all. Therefore I adviſe thee in the third place,</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>TO give up thy ſelf, thy Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, all the faculties of the one, and all the members of the other, together with all thou hast in the World, wholly and entirely to God through Chriſt Jeſus, uniting thy ſelf to him in the Cloſest manner, and by the strongeſt bonds that poſſibly thou can'st, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be his, and only his for ever.</hi> To make thee capable of doing this, was the deſign of my former Advice, and if thou can'ſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe that well, thou wilt readily follow this: for thoſe bonds being broken which kept thee from God, thou wilt as naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to him, as fire does aſcend upwards, when that which depreſſes it, or keeps it down, is removed from it; and therefore,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48385:67"/>the fewer words may ſerve to enforce this Advice upon thee. The heads of ſome few conſiderations I ſhall briefly offer thee, which thy own Thoughts may work upon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large as thou ſeeſt good. In the firſt place then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou muſt and do'ſt acknowledge thy ſelf to be God's Creature. He is the only Spring and Root of thy Being and Life. And is it not juſt then, that thou ſhouldeſt be and live to him, and to him alone? Art thou not a very unreaſonable Creature, if thou refuſeſt to be his, by whom alone thou art, and without whom thou can'ſt not be at all? Yes ſurely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou muſt acknowledge God to be the only Supporter, Preſerver, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of thy Life and Being; thou liveſt by him as ſurely, as the Tree by its Root, and if he withdraw his quickening Inſluence and Power but one Moment, thou art dead without Remedy. Thoſe Neceſſaries for the preſerving of life, which the World fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes thee withal, are all fallen from him; and all the virtue and efficacie they have for that purpoſe, is no leſs from him. It is he that refreſhes thee by Heat and Light, that nouriſhes thee by Meat and Drink, that cures thee by Medicine and Phyſick, and without him thou could'ſt have no Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48385:68"/>no Health, no Refreſhment. And with what Reaſon, then, can'ſt thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy ſelf from him? Surely with none at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. thou believeſt God to be thy Saviour, <hi>i.e.</hi> that he hath given thee his only begotten Son to deliver thee from Sin and Death, and to bring thee to everlaſting Life; and that as he in our Nature hath offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice upon the Croſs for thy Sins, ſo he hath undertaken to bring back thy erring and loſt Soul to God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art a moſt unworthy and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wretch, if thou wilt not comply with his gracious Undertaking, but refuſeſt to be Chriſt's, that thou may'ſt be God's for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou do'ſt believe and acknowledge, that for this End he hath taken Poſſeſſion of thee by his Holy Spirit, who is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually working in thee, to diſpoſe thee by putting off thy ſelf, and all ſelfiſh Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Deſires, and by abandoning all that is dear to thee, to offer up thy ſelf, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> offered up his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Sacrifice unto God. And therefore thou can'ſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Guilt of the moſt abominable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, take upon thee to be any thing, or to do any thing, but for God, and to God. See 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48385:68"/> 5. Thou haſt made a Show, an outward profeſſion of giving up thy ſelf to God, and being God's long agoe, This thou did'ſt at thy Baptiſme, when renouncing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and the Fleſh, thou did'ſt give up thy ſelf to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and this profeſſion thou haſt (probably) renewed often at the table of the Lord, where commemorating, and giving thanks to God for the greateſt expreſſion of the greateſt Love to Man that ever was, <hi>thou did'ſt offer and preſent thy ſelf, thy Soul and Body to be a Reaſonable, Holy, and Lively Sacrifice to the Lord;</hi> and thou haſt ſeemed to the World to this very day, to own all this. And therefore, if thou art not, if thou wilt not be God's, after all this, by the full conſent of thy heart, thou art the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and vileſt Hypocrite upon Earth, and an accurſed Traytor to thy great Creator, to thy Gracious and Loving Saviour. To all this thou may'ſt add,</p>
               <p n="6">6. That this is that Holineſs, which the Scriptures ſo frequently recommend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and without which thou can'ſt not hope to ſee the Lord. When things are ſeparated from common Uſes, and are given up to God ſo, as never to be made Uſe of, but for him, or in his Worſhip and Service,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48385:69"/>they are called Holy things; and ſo indeed they are, ſo far as things can be: Thus when thou haſt ſeparated thy ſelf, taken off thy heart from all created things, and haſt given up thy ſelf to God, to be his, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his, in faithful Service and Obedience for ever, thou art holy, and not till then; and if thou thinkeſt otherwiſe, thou do'ſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly deceive thy ſelf. Add to this,</p>
               <p n="7">7. That this is thy perfection, and the greateſt perfection thou art capable of. Thou can'ſt do nothing better, than to reſign thy ſelf to God; and thou can'ſt not poſſibly be in any better State, than in a State of pure reſignation to him. And therefore in the laſt place,</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thou may'ſt ſafely believe, that this is thy happineſs, and the greateſt happineſs thou can'ſt attain unto. The truth is, theſe three words, Holineſs, Perfection, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, though they differ in ſound, are all the very ſame in ſence and ſignification. He that ſaies, that the Saints in Heaven are bleſſed, ſaies no other thing than this, that they are made perfect; and he that ſaies, that they are made perfect, ſaies no other, thing than this that they are fully &amp; compleatly Holy: and he that ſpeaks this, ſaies no more,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48385:69"/>than that they are entirely God's, that they are perfectly diſengaged from every thing that might withhold them in the leaſt from him, and ſo united to him, that nothing can ſeparate or diſſolve the Union; ſo that all that I would now perſuade thee to, is but to make thy ſelf as periect, and happy as thou can'ſt be: and methinks in this caſe it ſhould be no hard matter to prevail with thee, when thou can'ſt not but ſee thy Intereſt in that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to thee as thy Duty, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if thou art the Man I now ſuppoſe thee to be, but thou muſt yield thy full Conſent unto it. And therefore I leave theſe things to thy ſerious thoughts, and proceed to give thee ſome Directions how to perform this good and happy Work.</p>
               <p>§. 2. That thou art concerned to take the greateſt Care that may be, to do it well, I preſume I need not tell thee; and therefore, as I do earneſtly recommend the following Directions to thee, ſo, I hope thou wilt not ſail to practiſe them. And becauſe it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great moment in every thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin well, I adviſe thee,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſeparate thy ſelf for ſome time from the World. Retire into thy Cloſet, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſecret place, where no Eye may
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48385:70"/>ſee thee, and nothing divert or diſturb thee. And when thou art there, conſider, that thou art come thither about a buſineſs of the greateſt Importance to thee; thou art to give thy ſelf to God, to unite thy ſelf moſt firmly to him; but of thy ſelf, and without God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace thou art not able to do it: if he does not draw thee, if he does not overcome thy ſorry Heart by the ſweet and powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Love, thou wilt make but faint and fained Offers of thy ſelf unto him. And therefore thou muſt not fail in the firſt place,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To fall upon thy Senſes, and with the greateſt Reverence and Submiſſion, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the Deſires of thy Soul, and to beg his favourable acceptance of them, and his Bleſſing upon them. And if thou knoweſt not how to do it better, thou may'ſt make Uſe of this form of words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My Lord, and my God, thou knoweſt the very bottom of my heart, and my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are not hid from thee: I am encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by my own happy experience of thy Goodneſs, as well as by thy gracious decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of thy Will, to preſent my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, notwithſtanding I know my ſelf to be unworthy of the leaſt Favour from
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48385:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>thee. I am aſhamed when I think how I have demeaned my ſelf hitherto towards thee; and that I have lived ſo long a Stranger, yea an Enemy to thee, taking upon me to diſpoſe of my ſelf, and to pleaſe my ſelf in the main Courſe of my Life, without the leaſt Regard to thee. I abhor my ſelf for it, and acknowledge that I deſerve for ever to be abandoned by thee; but thou haſt not dealt with me according to my deſerts, bleſſed be thy Goodneſs for it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I now deſire unfeignedly to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and renouncing all Intereſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in my ſelf, and deteſting all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ungodly Practices, I deſire to give up my ſelf wholly and entirely to thee: I would be thine, and only thine, in all Love and Service, in perfect Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for ever; but, I know I am nothing, and can do nothing of my ſelf, and if ever I am thine, as I deſire to be, I muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted wholly to thy Goodnes for it. O my God, my Saviour, and my Sanctifier, turn not away thy face from a poor Soul that ſeeks thee, and places all his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Comfort in thee: but as thou haſt kindled theſe good Deſires in my heart; ſo favour them with thy Bleſſing, and confirm, encreaſe, and ſatisfie them. Reject not that poor Gift, which I would
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48385:71"/>make of my ſelf unto thee, and enable me to make it in ſuch a manner, that it may be pleaſing and acceptable in thy ſight. Lord hear me, help me, and ſhew mercy to me, for Chriſt Jeſus's ſake, Amen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When thou haſt thus offered thy Deſires to God, riſe from thy knees, and either walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſitting, as thou thinkeſt beſt,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Begin to excite, and ſtir up thy Soul, to a perfect Surrender of it ſelf, by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments before laid down, preſſing them upon thy ſelf with all they Might. And that they may have as great an Influence upon thee as is poſſible, thou may'ſt imagine, that thou heareſt Almighty God ſpeaking to thee from Heaven in this manner: <q>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thy ſelf, O man, and take notice what thou art, and what good Things thou do'ſt poſſeſs; look upon thy body, and all its uſeful Members; conſider thy Soul, and all its Faculties and Powers, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſeveral Motions and Operations; and tell me whence thou art, and to whom thou art endebted for them. Look upon the World that furniſhes thee with all things neceſſary and fitting for thee; and tell me who was the framer of it, and who made it uſeful and ſerviceable to thee. Can'ſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48385:71"/>thou deny, that I have done all this? and vvherefore, then, haſt thou lifted up thy ſelf againſt me, and preſumed to act, as it thou had'ſt no dependance upon me, or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me? If thou ſoweſt thy ſeed in thy Field, thou expecteſt to reap the Crop; if thou did'ſt nouriſh, and provide for a poor beaſt, thou thinkeſt that thou may'ſt uſe him at thy pleaſure; if thou makeſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to work withal, thou challengeſt a Right to diſpoſe of it; But I have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and preſerved a creature, <hi>[hear and be aſhamed of thy ſelf]</hi> and thou wilt allow me no Right and Title to Him and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Tell me O thou unjuſt, and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Wretch, did I ever give thee Liberty to diſpoſe of thy ſelf? did I ever give thee occaſion to think, that I made no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thee, or that I expected no acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement from thee? No, wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thou did'ſt know that I made thee for my ſelf, and that I would not give away my Intereſt in thee; that I put a great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon thee, and that as I made thee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Serving me, ſo I expected and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it from thee: and therefore did I love thee from the Beginning, and beſtowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Gifts upon thee: I gave thee all things that were fitting for thee, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured thee, that I would withhold no good
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48385:72"/>thing from thee: yea, I gave thee my ſelf in mine own only begotten Son, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended out of my boſome to aſſure thee of my Love, as well as to convince thee, That thou had'ſt deſerved my hatred, Thou can'ſt rage againſt a poor ſervant that neglects thy Buſineſs, and ſeems to ſſight thee; yea, thy poor neighbour, that hath no dependance upon thee, ſhall feel the effects of thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if he chance to wrong thee: they muſt ſeek thy pardon and crouch before thee, and think themſelves beholden to thee, if by ſo doing they can make their peace: and yet I have Humbled my ſelf to thee, thou vile worme, and have not ſpared my own Son that I might ſpare thee, and bring thee to a due ſenſe of thy duty to me. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth can witneſs for me, that I have ſtooped low enough, in deſiring the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Rebellious Duſt and aſhes; and they ſhall alſo witneſs the Juſtice of my ſeverity to thee, if ſo much Love and Condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not work upon thee.</q> Here thou may'ſt pauſe a while, and obſerve how thy Soul is affected with theſe things; and then thou may'ſt imagine again, That thou heareſt Almighty God ſpeaking further to thee and more fully relating the wonderfull Hiſtory of his Love in Chriſt Jeſus. And after he hath given thee an account of his mean Birth,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48385:72"/>of his humble and painful Life, of his bloody and cruel death, and his Deſign and End in all this, proceeding to ſhew thee, with how much Love, and with what tender Regard for thee he left this World, and aſcended to his Father: and how, that after he had done, and ſuffered in his own Perſon, as much as was neceſſary and fitting for him; he ſent the Holy Ghoſt to compleat the great and good work of thy eternal Salvation. And then imagine that he tells thee, what that bleſſed and Holy Spirit hath for his part done for thee, what Gifts he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, what Wonders he hath wrought, what Arts and Methods he hath uſed, and with what Goodneſs and Patience, and Long-ſuffering, to bring thee to a right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and a real ſenſe of all his Love, and of all thy Duty to him; and to excite, encourage, and enable thee to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it: and in the End beſpeaking thee in this or the like manner: <q>And now, wretch that thou art, muſt all this Love be loſt upon thee: and muſt I loſe thee for ever, after all that I have done for thee; will nothing work upon thy hard heart; upon thy proud and ſtubborn Will; will nothing conquer the perverſneſs of thy Spirit? not the Commands of thy Maker, not the Death of thy Saviour:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48385:73"/>not the good motions and Inſpirations, of thy Sanctifier? Can'ſt thou withſtand my Power, that thou art thus obſtinate againſt my Goodneſs? and if thou wilt not ſuffer me to ſave thee, do'ſt thou think that I am not able to deſtroy thee? O foliſh Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unwiſe! conſider theſe things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and as thou oughteſt; remember what thou haſt done, and what unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Courſes thou haſt taken hitherto, and proceed no farther in thy Folly, but return to that I Love that calls thee, that entreats thee, that would ſave thee.</q> Here thou may'ſt pauſe a little, as before: and if any thing more be neceſſary, to ſhame and humble thee, to ſoften and melt thee: Thou may'ſt turn thy ſelf to conſider thy own Engagements, and to charge upon thy ſelf that monſtrous perfidiouſneſs which thou haſt, and wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be guilty of, if thou doſt now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Calls of God. And that thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs may appear the more deteſtable, thou may'ſt conſider in the laſt place, what that is which thou haſt been engaged, and art now called upon to do, it is not to do any thing unjuſt; diſhoneſt or unreaſonable: it is not to deſtroy thy ſelf, or to make thy ſelf miſerable: but on the contrary, it is to do the juſteſt, the moſt reaſonable and the beſt thing that thou art capable of doing:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48385:73"/>it is to return to the Author of thy Being, and thereby ſerve the End of thy creation, and conſult the only Happineſs, and Reſt of thy Soul: it is to unite thy ſelf to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good, to make thy ſelf his, and to make him hine for ever. And is this a thing ſo much againſt thee, that thou needeſt ſo much invitation and perſuaſion to it? <q>O my Soul! my fooliſh Soul, may'ſt thou ſay, what can'ſt thou ſay for thy ſelf in this Caſe? is there any Excuſe for thy Folly? any plea for thy Wickedneſs? no, far be it from thee to ſeek for any: let us rather amend what we have done amiſs, and be more wiſe for the time to come. Happy had we been, if we had needed from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo much invitation to deſtroy our ſelves; but ſince we could do that upon very little or none at all, let us no longer withſtand this which is ſo earneſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with us to ſave our ſelves.</q> Then turning thy ſelf to God, (in whoſe preſence thou haſt been all this while) thou may'ſt ſpeak (as I hope thou wilt be able with truth to do) in this manner to him: <q>I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, I am overcome, O God, I can no longer withſtand thy mighty Love; I muſt, I do yield my ſelf a captive to it. I am thine, I do acknow ledge by all Right, and I will be thine for ever, by the full conſent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48385:74"/>of my Heart. I can do no leſs in Return to that wonderful Love thou haſt ſhewed me; and I can do no more. O, let this little that I can do, be accepted by thee, and receive me for thine own: take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of me by thy Spirit, and let it preſerve me for ever to thy ſelf, according as I do now ſincerely reſign up my ſelf, and all I have to thee.</q> Then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Caſting thy ſelf upon the Ground, ſay thus: and ſay it with all thy Heart and Soul:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, my Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, do I give my Self Soul and Body, and all that belongs unto me, to be guided, governed, and diſpoſed of according to his Will, and to his Honour and Glory, and may he be a Witneſs to this my Act, which I promiſe never to revoke, and may I never obtain the leaſt Favour from him, if I do it not with with an upright Heart, and an unfeigned purpoſe to make it good to my Lives End. Thou art my Witneſs, O my God, be thou alſo my helper with thy continued Grace, and ſo ſhall I be faithful to thee according to my Heart's Deſire. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48385:74"/>
               <p> But then,</p>
               <p n="4">4. As in matters of the World, that which is done in private between Man and Man, muſt in ſome caſes receive a further Conſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by ſuch Solemnities as are appointed by humane Lawes; ſo that which thou haſt done thus between God, and thy own Soul, muſt be farther confirmed, and as it were compleated, by thoſe Solemnities which the Lawes of God do require; and therefore ſail not to take the firſt opportunity that is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to go to the Table of the Lord; and having prepared thy ſelf at home by ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations as I have before taught thee, and by reading ſome good book of the Holy Sacrament, (ſuch as Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Chriſtian Saacrifice, which I deſire, may find a place, both in thy Cloſet and in thy Heart) do thou there renew what thou haſt done in private, and as it were in publick Court, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it and conſirm it. At that Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le God will not fail to meet thee, attended with an innumerable Company of Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and he ſtrictly requires and expects it from thee. And therefore, when thou art at that Table, and beholdeſt what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Love is there ſhewed thee, and which cannot but draw thy very heart from thee, if thou do'ſt conſider it aright, remember what thou art to do, and let thy heart ſpeak
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48385:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this manner to Almighty God: <q>There is all the Reaſon in the World, O Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, that I ſhould give up my ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to thee, ſince thou haſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden thy Son, thy only Son from me; there is all the Reaſon in the World, O my Bleſſed Saviour, that I ſhould ſurrender my ſelf, and all I have, into thy hands, ſince thou did'ſt offer thy ſelf a Sacrifice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs for me, and do'ſt now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe Holy Pledges, of the all-ſufficient Virtue of that Sacrifice to me: there is all the Reaſon in the World, that I ſhould reſign my ſelf to thee, O Holy and Bleſſed Spirit, ſince thou do'ſt offer thy ſelf to be a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Holineſs and Life in me. And therefore, as I do now accept, with all thinkfulneſs, thoſe great and ineſtimable Favours, and do declare my acceptance of them in the ſight of theſe thy Servants, and all thy Holy Angels here preſent, by receiving thoſe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and Pledges of them, according to thy Command and Inſtitution; ſo, do I give up my ſelf and all I have to thee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it before the face of all theſe Witneſſes; and I earneſtly deſire, that even my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſelf may be accepted through this my poor Gift, the perfect Sacrifice and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my deareſt Saviour, and be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Holy Ghoſt, and be owned by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48385:75"/>my God, to the everlaſting pariſe of the Holy, Bleſſed, and Undivided Trinity, whoſe I am, and whoſe I will be for ever, and ever. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But then,</p>
               <p n="5">5. When thou art gone from this holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Retire as ſoon as poſſibly thou can'ſt, and whil'ſt theſe good thoughts are warm in thy breaſt, into thy Cloſet: and there take the Book of thy ſpiritual Accounts into thy hand, (for I would not have thee to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a Book, for recording theſe things wherein the Welfare of thy Soul is greatly concerned, leaſt thou be condemned by the Care, and exactneſs of thoſe whom we are wont to call good Husbands, in Worldly Matters) and with thy pen write thus: <q>In ſuch a Year and ſuch a Months, and on ſuch a day, I did through God's Grace, with all the Devotion of my Heart, and Soul, make an entire Surrender of my ſelf, and all things belonging to me, to Almighty God; proteſting and vowing, that he ſhould have the full guiding, governing, and diſpoſing of me, and mine for ever.</q> And then, that thou may'ſt have a more diſtinct Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what thou haſt done, and what thou art obliged to do for the time to come, thou may'ſt under write theſe following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48385:76"/>
                  <p>I have given up my ſelf entirely to God; and therefore I muſt not ſerve my ſelf, but Him all the dayes of my Life.</p>
                  <p>I have given him my Underſtanding: and therefore my chiefeſt Care and Study muſt be to know him, his Nature, his Perfections, his Works, his Will: Theſe muſt be the Subject of my Meditations night and day; as for all other things they muſt be as Droſs and Dung to me; <hi>and the Knowledge of them muſt be as loſs for the excellency of the Knowledge of God in Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>v.</hi> I muſt believe all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elations, and, ſilencing all the carnal Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt whatſoever he teaches me, I muſt reſt my ſelf on his veracity, being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that he can neither be deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor deceive me. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20.</p>
                  <p>have given him my Will: and therefore, I muſt have no Will of mine own: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he wills, I muſt will alſo; I muſt will his Glory in all things, as he does, and that muſt be my chief End in every thing: I muſt prefer it before all deſireable things, and ſubordinate my own Deſires, Delights and Satisfactions to it: I muſt ſay, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> did, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth, that I deſire beſides thee, Pſal.</hi> 73.25. I muſt do whatſoever God commands me, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48385:76"/>forbear whatever he forbids; and I muſt do it for this Reaſon chiefly, becauſe he does command or forbid me: nay, <hi>I muſt delight to do it, Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>v.</hi> And it muſt be to me <hi>as my meat and drink, John</hi> 4.34. I muſt conſent to ſuffer whatever he will lay upon me, and though it may be his Pleaſure to lay hard things upon me, and grievous to be born, yet I muſt not repine, or murmur, but with Cheerfulneſs, Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and Thankfulneſs, I will ſubmit my ſelf to it. Whatever threatens me, I muſt ſay, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1. Sam. 3.18. and whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls me, I <hi>must give thanks, for that is his Will concerning me in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18.</p>
                  <p>I have given him all the Paſſions, and Affections of my Soul; and therefore he muſt diſpoſe of them, govern, and ſet bounds unto them. he muſt have my Love, my Fear, my Delight, my Joy; and nothing in the World muſt have any Share in theſe, or any other of my Affections, but with reſpect to him, and for his ſake. What he loves, I muſt love; what he hates, I muſt hate; what he is well pleaſed with, I muſt rejoyce in; what he is grieved with, I muſt mourn for; the Objects of his Pity I muſt have compaſſion on, and thoſe of his wrath and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48385:77"/>Indignation I muſt be zealous againſt: and all in ſuch meaſures, and Degrees as he is pleaſed to preſcribe me.</p>
                  <p>I have given him my Body; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt glorify him with it: I muſt not dare to abuſe it by Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Adultery, Fornication, or any other Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs: I muſt look upon it as his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore muſt preſerve it pure and Holy fit for my God to dwell in. See 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.19. I muſt not wrong it by pampering or indulging it; nor by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, nor ſhewing too much Rigor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, in overmuch faſting, watching, labouring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But muſt keep it, as far as in me lies, Healthy, Vigorous, active, and fit to do him all manner of Service that he ſhall call for.</p>
                  <p>I have given him my Senſes, my Eyes, my Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore, to good they muſt be alwayes open, but to Evil, and all the Occaſions of it, they muſt be ſhut.</p>
                  <p>I have given him all my Members: and therefore they muſt be no longer Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Unrighteouſneſs unto Sin, [<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13.] but Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto God. My tongue muſt ſhew forth his Praiſe; my hands muſt do his Works; and my foot muſt carry me with ſpeed unto it.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48385:77"/>
                  <p> I have given him not my ſelf only, but alſo all that do belong unto me; and therefore my Children my Friends, my Servants muſt all be his, if I can make them ſo.</p>
                  <p>I have given him all my Worldly Goods; and therefore I muſt prize them, and uſe them only for him: his Houſe, his Prieſts, his Poor muſt have their Portions from me with a willing mind; and though I have no more than neceſſaries for my Life, yet I muſt be content to part with them, when my Lord ſhall need them, or command me to reſign them.</p>
                  <p>I have given him my Credit, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and therefore I muſt value it, and endeavour to maintain it only in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, as it may do him ſervice, and advance his Honour in the World.</p>
                  <p>I have given him my ſelf and all; and therefore I muſt look upon my ſelf to be nothing, and to have nothing out of him: he muſt be the ſole Diſpoſer, Governour, and Guider of my ſelf and all: He muſt be my Portion, and my All.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And then, in the cloſe thou may'ſt add this:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Thus have I given my ſelf to God, and and to all this have I bound my ſelf in the moſt ſolemn manner; and with my own
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48385:78"/>hand do I now teſtify my full conſent unto it, and I am reſolved to make good the Whole, and every part of it, God aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, to my Lives End. I doubt not but I ſhall meet with many temptations to the Contrary, I ſhall be often told of my Singularity and Preciſeneſs, and ſome may tell me in kindneſs, that I do more than is neceſſary, and that I muſt accommodate or fit my ſelf to this or that perſon, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Thing, Cuſtome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But my Anſwer ſhall be to all, I am not my own, I am not for my ſelf, nor for my Friends, nor for the World, nor for its Cuſtomes; but for my God. I will give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> what I owe to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and to God what I owe to God. The Lord be merciful to me his unworthy Servant.</p>
               </q>
               <p>All this I ſay thou wilt do well to write in thy Book of Spiritual Accounts; but if thou can'ſt not write ſail not to fix it in thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and as often as thou art called to the table of the Lord, take a View of it, or repeat it to thy ſelf; and call thy ſelf ſtrictly to as account how thou haſt made it good, and how and wherein thou haſt failed; and give God thanks for what thou haſt been able to do, and humble thy ſelf before him for all that thou haſt omitted, conſeſſing it with ſorrow, and earneſtly begging pardon for

But did I ſay, that thou muſt do this as often as thou art called to the Table of the Lord? I muſt tell thee, that thou ſhould'ſt do it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: thou ſhould'ſt do it once a week at leaſt, upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening, or early in the morning on the Lord's day; for, ſo often at leaſt were the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians wont to receive the Holy sacrament, and that we do it not as often as they did, is not for our Praiſe or Commendation; and indeed to put of this, till our uſual Times of Communicating, is to put it off to a time when we can hardly do it well; becauſe many things will be forgotten by us, or elſe we ſhall be overwhelmed with too great a multitude. There is not one but will find Work enough at the End of one week, to call to mind, how his heart has been diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, his tongue imployed, and what good or evil Deeds he hath done, with the ſeveral Circumſtances belonging unto them, during that time; and how imperfect an Account of theſe things, then, can they give to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to Almighty God, who are to look back a full Quarter of a Year, and to call all their wayes to remembrance? let this therefore, I pray thee, at leaſt as often
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48385:79"/>as I have ſaid, and though thou can'ſt not be ſo happy, as to communicate thus often, yet this will in ſome meaſure ſupply the want of it, and put thee into a better diſpoſition, to give thy ſelf to God in the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to unite thy ſelf more firmly to him. I muſt confeſs, I am not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee, but thou wilt diſcern many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings when thou comeſt thus to examine thy ſelf, though thou haſt been ever ſo careful, to keep cloſe to God, and to demean thy ſelf as God's: but yet, let not this diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee in the leaſt, becauſe thou haſt to do with a God that knows thy frailty, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in Mercy and Compaſſion towards thee; and as long as thou do'ſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thy heart from him, nor ſlack thy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make good thy Reſolutions and Vowes, thou may'ſt reſt thy ſelf aſſured, that thou ſhalt not want the choiceſt To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his Love, I mean a dayly Supply of Grace, and ſtrength to obey and pleaſe him. Thou may'ſt feel thy ſelf at firſt to be weak as a little Child; but be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at it, for thou wilt find in a little time, that That Spirit which firſt breathed into thee this new life, will preſerve and cheriſh it, and make thee to <hi>grow up to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt. Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:48385:79"/>
               <p> Thus have I ſhewed thee, (my dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) how thou may'ſt become a real Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>i.e.</hi> in the Language of the Scripture, <hi>a new Creature in Christ Jeſus</hi> 2. <hi>Corin.</hi> 5.17. And let me tell thee for thy Comfort, that when theſe things are done, thou may'ſt ſafely account thy ſelf to be one, and all thoſe Privileges, which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures aſſure thee do belong to real Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, thou may'ſt juſtly challenge as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy ſelf. Are they one with Chriſt? ſo art thou. Have they the Spirit of Chriſt? ſo haſt thou. Have they fellowſhip with the Father and the Son? ſo haſt thou. Are they the Children of God, Heirs of God, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt? ſo art thou. This is an happy and Honourable Eſtate, no ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul can aim at any thing higher, no heart can deſire any thing better. It is that, to which all that call themſelves Chriſtians do pretend; but they, and they only, that have thus reſigned themſelves to God, have attained to it. But now I muſt tell thee, that by how much the greater thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in this Eſtate, by ſo much the more thou art concerned to take Care that thou fall not away from it, and to uſe all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to keep thy ſelf in a firm poſſeſſion of it; remembring that thou art not yet in Heaven, where there is no Falling away from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48385:80"/>God, but in a place of Manifold Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where many do draw back, and after they <hi>have known the way of Righteouſneſs, do turn from it.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, for which purpoſe I muſt proceed to give thee ſome further Directions, but contracting my thoughts as much as may be, that I may not burden thee with too big a Book.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> Containing the Fourth Advice, To grow in the Knowledge of God and of the things of God. <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Countaining ſeveral Directions how to improve in all Divine Knowledge.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>THou must endeavour dayly to grow in the Knowledge of God, and to get more clear, diſtinct, firm, well-ſetled appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the things of God.</hi> The Reaſon of this Advice is very plain, <hi>viz.</hi> That the more thou knoweſt of God, and the more clear they apprehenſions of Divine things are, the better thou wilt love God, and the more cloſely will thy heart cleave unto him. There are ſome things indeed of ſuch a nature, that the leſs men know them, the more they eſteem and love them: whil'ſt they look upon them at a diſtanced, and know them but imperfectly, they ſeem great and good, worthy of their Eſteem and Love; but when they come to handle them, and know them throughly, they are convinced that they deſerve neither. But
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48385:81"/>now the things of God are of another Sort; ſuch is the Perfection of their Nature, that the more they are unfolded to us, the more we admire them, and the more ſtrongly do they draw our Souls towards them: and if there by any men that do not value them, or are not in Lore with them, we may be confident that they do not know them. Is it I that ſpeak this? or doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo ſpeak the ſame? Why then doth it ſo often tell us of wicked men, <hi>That they know not God, that they know not the way of the Lord, nor the Judgments of their</hi> God, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 5.5. and <hi>cap.</hi> 9.4. <hi>v.</hi> And what is it, that St. <hi>John</hi> means, when he tells us, <hi>That by this we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandements: he that ſaith he knoweth him, and keepeth not his Commandements, is a Lyar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3, 4. Doth not this imply plainly, that they who know God truly, will obey him, and that the Reaſon why they do not love and obey him, is their Ignorance of him, or the Imperfection of their Knowledge? either they know not God at all, or their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſo weak, ſo ſleight, ſo Imperfect, that it makes little or no Impreſſion upon their hearts: their Conceptions of God are like thoſe Conceipts which we have of ſome things in our ſleep, which either affect us
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48385:81"/>not at all, or are forgotten by us, as ſoon as we awake. We believe, and we believe rightly, That the Saints in Heaven ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall from God, but will love and ſerve him for ever, without the leaſt Failing or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection: and what is the Reaſon of it? Surely it is becauſe they <hi>know his as they are known of him</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.12. Or as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>they ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>i.e.</hi> they have the cleareſt, firmeſt, the moſt full and comprehenſive Knowledge of him, that Creatures can have, by which they are transformed into his Image, and made like unto him. He that does know God truly, does alſo know himſelf; and he that does know God and himſelf truly, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but keep himſelf in a State of Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Subjection to God continually. He will feel thoſe Impreſſions upon himſelf, which holy <hi>Job</hi> did, when God had made himſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better known unto him, than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, [See <hi>Job</hi> 38.39.] and will ſay from the very bottom of his heart, as holy <hi>Job</hi> did; <hi>Behold I am vile, chap.</hi> 40.4. <hi>v.</hi> he will know, that it is not for a Worm to contend with the Creator of all things, not for him that was born like a wild Aſſes Colt, (as one of <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends ſpeaks) to preſume to find out the Almighty to perfection. He will feel the truth of what the Pſalmiſt ſaies,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48385:82"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their Trust in thee:</hi> and will heartily aſſent to that Saying of a great man, <hi>That the more we reject our ſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mich. de Montaign.</note> 
                  <hi>and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to God, the better it is for us.</hi> He will ſay as a devout man once did; <hi>What art Thou O Lord, and what am I?</hi> He will be continually admiring his Sovereign Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, andwill be no leſs ſenſible of his own worthleſneſs, and nothingneſs. He that knows God truly, will alſo know the World; and he that knows God and the World aright, will never be drawn from God by any of the World's Allurements; he will know, that the World is nothing of it ſelf; And will he ſet his heart upon that which is not? He will know, that without God, it can contribute no more to his happineſs, than it did to his Being, which he knows himſelf indebted only to God for: and can that ſteal away his heart from the Author of all Good, which never did, nor can beſtow the leaſt Godd upon thee? How vile doth this Earth ſeem unto us, when we liſt up our Eyes and look upon the Heavens? Surely much morevilewill all things be eſteemed by him, whoſe Soul is poſſeſſed with a true Knowledge of the maker of them. It was therefore a true Saying of a Holy man of old [St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>] <hi>That no man loſes God, but he that is deceived.</hi> And another perſon
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48385:82"/>many years after him, is ſaid to ſpeak no worſe, when being in an extaſy, he cryed out: <hi>O my God! O my Lord! O the God of my Heart! O that all men did know thee! they would never offend thee, they would ever love thee.</hi> For ſurely, (as the Author of the <hi>Book of Wiſdome</hi> tells us) <hi>To know God is perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and to know his Power is the root of Immortality, Wiſd.</hi> 15.4. This my ſuffice to ſhew thee the Reaſon of my Advice. Let me now as rieſly, direct thee how to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. To this Purpoſe let me tell thee,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That thou art not concerned to know as much as may be known of God, or as learned men do know: but only ſo much as is neceſſary, or as may be helpful to keep thee entirely reſigned, and obedient to his Will; and therefore thou muſt not trouble thy ſelf with thoſe nice and curious Speculations in Religion, which are of no Uſe or tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to this End. That Knowledge, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyer the Object of it is, which will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to make thee better, or prevent thy becoming worſe than thou art, is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, uſeleſs and unproſitable; the Hunting after it hath ruined thouſands, but never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one Soul. Thoſe that purſue after it, are thus deſeribed by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48385:83"/>
                  <hi>They conſent not to wholſome words, and to the Doctrine which is according to Godlyneſs, they are proud, knowing nothing, but doting about Queſtions and ſtrifes of Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though thou art not concerned to know as much as may be known of God, yet thou muſt endeavour to know theſe great and uſeful things I have ſpoken of, as well as poſſibly thou can'ſt; and therefore, thou muſt not content thy ſelf with that ſleight, ſuperficial Knowledge, which the generality of Men have of them, who rather dream of divine things than know them, but thou muſt labour for a clear, diſtinct apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, and for a firm and well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſuaſion, both of the Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them. And to this Purpoſe, thou muſt</p>
               <p n="3">3. Apply thy ſelf to the Uſe of all good Means, and that with great Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; remembring, That if it be Folly to do meaner things ſlerghtly, (as certainly it is, becauſe many things many times depend upon our leaſt actions) to be careleſs and ſleight in ſuch a manner as this, can be no leſs than Madneſs. Now the means that you are to uſe, are theſe that follow:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Rcading the Holy Scriptures, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48385:83"/>them read; this thou art to do dayly; thou muſt borrow ſome part of every day (to ſay nothing here of what thou art to do upon Holy dayes) from thy Worldly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, to read or hear them read. Our Bleſſed Saviour bids us <hi>Search the Scriptures, becauſe in them we think we have eternal Life, John</hi> 5.39. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that they are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. And if any mans words are of greater weight with us, than theirs, we do ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Name of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reading Good Books; I call thoſe good, which treat of the great things of God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, diſcreetly, plainly, convincingly, and affectionately: of which ſort I know not many in the World, and therefore thou art to take the beſt Advice thou can'ſt have, in the choice of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hearing of Sermons and good Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made by Chriſt's Miniſters, whether in the Pulpit upon particular Texts of Scripture, or in the desk, as expoſitions of ſome larger Portions of it, or of ſome of the chiefeſt Points of Religion, contained in the Catechiſm. Theſe Diſcourſes Chriſt's Miniſters are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make, for the Edification of Chriſt's Church, [See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2.] and therefore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48385:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſtian people muſt needs think themſelves bound to attend unto them, and they are over wiſe or over good, that conceit they have no need of them; I mean, that they are neither wiſe nor good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Frequent conferring with ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians about divine things, which is a means of Improving Knowledge, that hath ſeveral Advantages above any other; for beſides this, we ſhall inſtruct others as well as our ſelves, imparting our own Knowledge to them, whil'ſt we receive of theirs; that which we thus learn, we apprehend more clearly, and are more deeply affected with, than we are with that which we receive any other way; and therefore, it is much to be lamented, that it is no more uſed by thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, than we ſee it is: and if we may not infer from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of it, that men are not ſo knowing in the things of God, as they take upon them to be; I am ſure we may conclude from it, that they are not ſo good as they ought to be: they ſeldom forbear to talk of that which they love, when there is occaſion offered for it; ſo they would never be ſilent in theſe things, if they had that hearty affection for them, which they ought to have. And as for the common Excuſe among the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48385:84"/>ſort of people, that they would not be taken for Hypocrites, (as too many in this laſt Age, among whom this hath been in Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have diſcovered themſelves to be;) it is ſo far from juſtifying their Neglect, that it manifeſts the naughtineſs of their hearts, whil'ſt they ſhew their ſelves more careful for their own Eſteem among men, than for the Honour of God, and the great Concerns of their Souls. There would be little or no Religion ſeen in the World, if the Abuſe of it by Hy pocrites would warrant men to caſt off the Profeſſion of it; and to give any good Reaſon, why ſo uſeful a part of it, ſhould for that cauſe be laid aſide, whil'ſt they think themſelves concerned to appear Religious in other things, I believe will puzzle the moſt ſubtle among them. There were too many Hypocrites in Holy David's time, and <hi>yet his tongue did not ceaſe to ſpeak of God's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of his praiſe all the day long, Pſal.</hi> 35, 28. And the Apoſtles times were not ſo happy, as to be without them, and yet They called upon Chriſtians, <hi>to exhort one another dayly, Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>And to teach and admoniſh each other, and that by Pſalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,</hi> as well as other wayes. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16. Thoſe good men did never think, that the danger of bemg accounted Hypocrites would diſcharge them from <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48385:85"/>their Diſcourſes with Salt,</hi> or from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things in their Converſation with each other, as might be profitable, <hi>and miniſter</hi> Grace <hi>unto the Hearers, Epheſ.</hi> 4.29. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 6.4. and why we ſhould think, that it becomes us to uſe that unprofitable, not to ſay that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, Communication which dayly proceeds from our Mouths, without having any reſpect to the edifying of one another in that which is good, I cannot underſtand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Meditating frequently upon the good things we read and hear. This is another means for the improvement of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the things of God, and it is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that without it all the reſt will avail us but very little; for this is the chewing, or tather the digeſting of what we read and hear: it is that which implants thoſe notices of things which we have got into our heads, in our hearts, and makes them to bring ſorth thoſe good Fruits which in their own Nature they are fit to do.<note place="margin">Mich. de Montaign</note> It was a good Obſervation of a great man ſome years ago, That in all humane ſects, there were never any, what difficulty or ſtrangeneſs ſoever their Doctrine maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but would in ſome ſort conform their Behaviour, and ſquare their Lives unto it; whereas this Divine and Heavenly Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we pretend to prefer before all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48385:85"/>Doctrines that ever were in the World, ſeldom makes Chriſtians but by the tongue; of which this Reaſon may be given, as pertinent to our preſent buſineſs, that thoſe being in Love with their Doctrines, how abſurd ſoever they were, either becauſe they were of their own Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or becauſe they had their firſt Inventors in great admiration, did ſo exerciſe their thoughts upon them, that their Souls could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch Impreſſions from them, as appeared in their outward Behaviour; whereas moſt of thoſe that are called Chriſtians, having no ſuch kindneſs for this Heavenly doctrine, or the Author of it, do never employ their thoughts about it; or if they do, it is ſo ſeldom, and in ſo ſleight, and careleſs a manner, that it cannot work any good effect upon them. Did they meditate dayly upon it, as holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did upon God's Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. did they examine its truth, did they weigh its Goodneſs, did they apply it to themſelves, and make tryal of its Force and Power upon their Souls, they would be ſo faſhioned to the Image and Likeneſs of it, as to be known by their Lives and Converſations from all other men. Thou muſt be frequent then in the Uſe of this mean, and let no day paſs thee without ſpending ſome time in it: and if thou art in ſuch Circumſtances at any time, that thou muſt either omit to read good Books,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48385:86"/>or to meditate. I adviſe thee to omit that, rather than this: for he that reads but little, and meditates much, will be a wiſer, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man, than he that reads much, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates none, or but very little.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Prayer. This is a means which muſt accompany all the reſt, and ought never to be omitted; for certain it is, that we can know no more of God, than we are taught by him; if he do not manifeſt himſelf unto us, if he do not enlighten our Minds, and aſſiſt our Endeavours, we ſhall advance but little by all we can do. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, that <hi>it is God that teacheth men Knowledge, Pſal.</hi> 94.10. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge are the Gifts of his Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. and if we deſire that Spirit, or thoſe Gifts, we muſt ask for them; for, thus did the Holy men of old, as the Scripture aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.4. <hi>v. Pſal.</hi> 119.66. <hi>v.</hi> And this the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught us to do, when he prayed for the <hi>Coloſſians, That they might beſilled with the Knowledge of God, in all Wiſdome, and ſpiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding; That they might walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleaſing, being fruitſul in every good Work, and encreaſing, in the Knowledge of God. Coloſſ.</hi> 1.9, 10. And then in the laſt place,</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:48385:86"/> 7. There is another means of improving our Knowledge, of as great Uſe, though little thought of, as any of the former; <hi>viz.</hi> the making a right Uſe of that which we know, by applying it to practice, and regulating our Lives and Converſations according to it: by thus uſing what we know, we ſhall come to know it better, for there is no Knowledge comparable to that, which we call experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; and he that <hi>taſts</hi> how good the Lord is, and how good the things of God are, which is the word by which the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> expreſſes this Knowledge <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>v.</hi> knows them as much better than others do, as they that taſt the ſweetneſs of Honey, know it better than they that have only heard of it. Beſides, by this Uſe of what we know, we are put into a better diſpoſition to know thoſe things which as yet we know not; for, as ſome of the old Heathen wiſe men were wont to ſay, <hi>as no eye can behold the Sun, if it hath not the Image of the Sun in it, ſo no man is capable of understanding the things of God, but he whoſe Soul is in ſome meaſure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned to the likeneſs of God;</hi> and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a more skilful man in Divine things, than the wiſeſt of them, I mean St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who tells us, <hi>that the Natural</hi> (or <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>) <hi>man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, becauſe they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48385:87"/>are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 2.14. which aſſertion is grounded upon this truth, That there muſt be ſome conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the knowing faculty, and the thing to be known, or elſe there can be no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and therefore, if we do not improve that little Knowledge which we have by the light of Nature, according to thoſe ſmall Remains of God's Image in us, to the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our naughty corrupt affections; and if we uſe not thoſe external Helps to that light which God gives, to the ſpiritualizing of our Minds, we can never truly underſtand the things of the Spirit: whereas, doing this, we ſhall be able to judge (or to diſcern them) clearly. And this is that which our great Maſter teaches us, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. where he ſhews us what we muſt do to attain a true and ſaving Knowledge of his Doctrine; <hi>if any man will do his Will, he ſhall know of my Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> and in another place, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to the Practical Uſe of what we know, he tells us, <hi>He that keepeth my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and manifest my ſelf unto him, John</hi> 14.21. <hi>v.</hi> Thus have I ſhewed thee how thou muſt endeavour to improve thy ſelf in the Knowledge of God. I now
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48385:87"/>proceed to give thee ſome further Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

               <p>§. 1. <hi>TThou muſt live alwaies as in God's Sight, or</hi> (<hi>as the Words of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt are</hi> Pſal. 16.8.) <hi>thou must ſet God alwaies before thee.</hi> This is a Rule of ſo great Uſe in a Holy Life, that ſome ſpiritual Guides have thought, that it may ſerve inſtead of all other Rules. And truly, if we ſuppoſe men to have that ſound Knowledge of God, which I have but now adviſed thee to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I know no reaſon but it may; however, the Uſefulneſs of it muſt be acknowledged to be great, and it lies ſo plain, that many words need not be uſed to ſhew it thee; for if clear and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48385:88"/>ſound apprehenſions of God's Majeſty, of his ſovereign Power, unſearcheable Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Truth will poſſeſs our hearts with Love, and Fear, and bow our Wills to his Obedience, as I have ſhewed thee that they will: Surely that which will keep thoſe apprehenſions alwayes preſent, and in Force upon our Minds, (as the Practice of this Rule will do,) will keep us alwayes reſign'd and obedient to him. We know by Experience, that the Eyes of thoſe whom we honour, and in whoſe Favour we deſire to be, have a great Influence upon us, and make us take heed to our ſelves, and to all our Behaviour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Maſters of Virtue among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were wont to adviſe their Scholars to imagine ſome excellent perſon, for whom they had a great veneration, to be alwaies preſent with them, as an obſerver of their actions. And can the remembrance of God's All-ſeeing Eye be leſs powerful with us, to make us cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in our wayes, and careful to approve our ſelves in all things to him? Can we have a greater Regard to the Eyes of Mortal Men, whoſe Favour or good opinion can never ſtand us but in little ſtead, than we have to the Eyes of the Everlaſting God, in whoſe Favour is Life, and in whoſe approbation, conſiſts our everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? No; it is impoſſible. <hi>I have thougth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48385:88"/>on thy name,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, and <hi>have kept thy Law.</hi> And in another place, <hi>my wayes are alwaies before thee, therefore have I kept thy Precepts and thy Teſtimonies, Pſal.</hi> 119.168. <hi>v.</hi> It is not unknown that ſome of the worſt of Men, are ſometimes reſtrained from doing evil, by the thoughts of God's preſence; and the great Care that moſt of them take to avoid thinking upon God, is no mconſiderable Argument, that the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alwayes in their Minds, would prove an abſolute Cure to their wickedneſs: For, wherefore do they put away the thoughts of him as much as they can, but becauſe they are ſenſible, that thoſe thoughts would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to become new men, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh thoſe ſilthy Practices, which they cannot ſind in their Hearts to ſorſake? It is a good Story and may ſitly have a place here, which we have from one of the Fathers of the Church if my memory fails me not, <q>of a young man who being tempted by a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Strumpet, ſeemed to conſent to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Deſires, but required ſome ſecret place to content her: She therefore lead hin into a private Room, and when he excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as not private enough, ſhe led him into another, and that not plcaſing him, ſhe brought him into the moſt ſecret place in the houſe, and told him, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48385:89"/>it was not poſſible any Eye ſhould ſee him there, or that any ſhould come to interrupt them: But then the young man putting on a more ſerious Countenance, demanded of her, Whether ſhe thought that they could there be concealed from the Eyes of Almighty God? with which Queſtion, and ſome ſhort Diſcourſe that was pertinent to it, he did not only cool her Luſt for the preſent, but converted her altogether from her filthy Courſe of Life.</q> Now, if the conſideration of God's preſence does ſometimes work theſe good effects upon ſome of the worſt of men, who neither know him truly, nor love him heartily, and who have been ſo ſar from both, that they have preferred the pooreſt Objects of their Luſts before him, how happy will the effects of it be upon thoſe, who have ſo known and loved him, as to renounce both themſelves and the World for his ſake, who love him as much for his Goodnes as they fear him for his Power; and who had rather dye, than diſpleaſe him, not ſo much becauſe he can puniſh, as becauſe they know him to be worthy of all the Love, Service and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that they can poſſibly pay unto him? Surely, as thoſe men cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to think of him, and cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves happy, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies under ſo good an Eye; ſo the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48385:89"/>&amp; conſideration of it, muſt needs keep them conſtantly reſigned to him, and in all things obedient to his Will. Thus much for the Reaſon of my Advice: I proceed</p>
               <p>§. 2. To direct thee in the Practice of it It muſt be coonfeſt, that it will be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſome to practiſe it: thoſe that are Slaves to their fleſh, and to the World, and are not at liberty to think ſeriouſly of any thing elſe, and whoſe Conſciences are burthen'd with the Guilt of many Sins, will find it very difficult, if not impoſſible, though they be ever ſo well directed: Such men muſt firſt practiſe the Duties of Self-Denyal, and Reſignation: But to thoſe that are reſcued from under the Tyranny of thoſe cruel Maſters, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſigned to God, and united to him by Lore, as I hope thou art, nothing can be more eaſy, pleaſant and delightful, our Souls willingly empolying their thoughts upon that which they Love, and gladly embrace ing all opportunities of being in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and therefore very brief Directions may ſuffice thee concerning t, and</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let me advertiſe thee, that the Practice of it muſt be grounded upon a firm perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's Omnipreſence, and Omniſcience: he <hi>fills Heaven and Earth,</hi> as himſelf thells us
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48385:90"/>
                  <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.24. He encompaſſes them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and He fills them within; and as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aſſures us, <hi>all things are naked and open to his Eyes, chap.</hi> 4.13. they pierce to the very marrow of our Bones, and to the bottom of our Intrails; they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company all the extravagant wandrings of our Imaginations, and diſcover the hidden Images of our memories: they look through the Cloſet-Foldings of our hearts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the moſt ſubtil Devices of our Spirits. Now, the firm belief of thoſe things being laid for a Foundation, thou muſt accuſtome thy ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To behold God in every thing; though he is no where to be ſeen by the Eye, yet thy mind may perceive him in every place, and in every thing, in the Heavens above, and in the Earth beneath, and in every part and corner of them: in the men thou converſeſt with, and in the beaſts thou ruleſt over; in the Fouls of the Air, and the Fiſh of the Sea; in the Graſs of the Field, and the Trees of the Forreſt; in thy ſelf, and in every thing round about thee; in all theſe he may be clearly diſcerned exerting that Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Goodneſs, which firſt gave Being to them, in ſuſtaining, preſerving and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them. And does he thus lye open to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48385:90"/>thee in every thing, and has he made thee capable of diſcerning him, and wiſt thou take no notice of him? far be it from thee. But then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thou muſt not only behold God in every thing, but thou muſt behold him in every thing looking upon thee, obſerving what Regard thou haſt to him, what Reſpect thou beareſt him, and how thou demeaneſt thy ſelf before him; as thy Heart muſt tell thee whereſoever thou art, and whatſoever thou lookeſt upon, that God is there; ſo it muſt tell thee likewiſe, that there God ſeeth thee. God is with thee every where, and his Eyes are alwaies upon thee; be thou alſo at all times with God, by an actual Remembrance of him, and the Application of thy mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> committed great wickedneſs, becauſe they ſaid in their hearts, <hi>God hath forſaken the Earth, and the Lord ſeeth not Ezek.</hi> 9.9. do thou bring thy heart to tell thee the Contrary in all thy wayes, and that will reſtrain thee from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evil thing. But then to make this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice both more profitable, and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to thee, thou wilt do well in the laſt place,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48385:91"/> 4. To accuſtom thy ſelf to frame ſome Acts of Love upon every apprehenſion of God's preſence, and in all Humility of Soul to offer them unto him. As God is worthy of the greateſt Love of our Souls, ſo in every thing we look upon, he appears to be ſo: and therefore it is very fit, that we ſhould expreſs our ſelves tob e ſenſible of it, by ſome Acts of Love, as often as any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him to our minds: now theſe Acts may be made ſeveral wayes; I will ſet thee down ſome of the chiefeſt of them, to the end that thou may'ſt more readily lay hold upon all occaſions that are offered thee for ſo good an Exerciſe. They may be made,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of Admiration and Tranſport. Thus, O God how great is thy Majeſty! how great is thy Goodneſs towards the Sons of men! what manner of Love is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiht thou haſt loved us! O <hi>the depth of the Riches, both of the Wiſdome and Knowlede of God! how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11.33.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of Eſteem and Preference. Thus may'ſt thou ſay, as a devout man was wont, <hi>My God and all things!</hi> and as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>None but Christ, None but Chriſt:</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48385:91"/>as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire beſides thee,</hi> Pſal. 73.25. and again, <hi>There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any Good? but Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us,</hi> Pſal. 4.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By way of Proteſtation, and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> thrice to his dear Lord and Maſter, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> John 21.15. Thus the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will love thee O Lord my ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 18.1. <hi>v.</hi> and in another Pſalm, <hi>I have ſworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy Righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Pſal. 119.106.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By way of Deſire and Aſpiration. Thus may'ſt thou ſay with a Holy Father, <hi>Let me find thee, O the Deſire of my Heart; let me poſſeſs thee, O Love of my Soul! Let me hold thee fast for ever in the very midſt of my heart, Obleſſed Life! O Sovereign ſweetneſs of my Soul!</hi> [St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>] or with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. <hi>As the Heart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee O God; my Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God; when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> Pſal. 42.1, 2. When will the Lord call home his baiſhed? when ſhall I return to my Father's Houſe?</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:48385:92"/> 5. By way of Oblation and Reſignation. As thus, Lord I am thine, I am thine by a thouſand Titles, and I will be thine, and none but thine for ever; thine I am, thine is all I have, and therefore to thee do I reſign my ſeli and all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By way of Humiliation, and Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus good <hi>Jacob, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy Mercies</hi> Geneſ. 32.10. and <hi>thus Holy</hi> Job, <hi>behold I am vile,</hi> chap. 40.4. and thus likewiſe the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Lord what is man, that thou takeſt Knowledge of him, or the Son of man, that makeſt account of him? Man is like to vanity, his dayes are as a ſhadow that paſſeth away,</hi> Pſal. 144.3, 4. <hi>v.</hi> What art thou O Lord? and what am I? Surely thou art the fulneſs of Being, but I am nothing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By way of Confidence and Religance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. Thus, can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the Son of her Womb? yea, thy may forget, but God will not forget his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Though my Father and Mother forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me, yet the lord will take me up: though I periſh, yet will I truſt in him. He cloaths the Lillies of the Field, and ſeeds the Fouls of the Air, and will he not feed and cloath me? He hath given me his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getten Son, and will he not with him give me all things?</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:48385:92"/> 8. By way of Benediction and Praiſe. Thus, Great is the Lord, and worthy to be praiſed, yea, his Name is exalted above all Bleſſing and Praiſe. All thy works ſhall praiſe thee O Lord, and all thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee. Whil'ſt I live, I will praiſe the Lord, I will ſing Praiſes unto God whil'ſt I have any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the wayes, wherein Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men have been wont to expreſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Love to God, and in ſome or other of theſe I would have thee to be continually exerciſing and expreſſing thine, according as occaſion is given thee, or as the things that bring God to hy Mind do direct and lead thee. Thou wilt not be long accuſtomed to theſe Practices, but thou wilt be ſenſible of ſuch Advantage by them, as no words of man can expreſs: thou wilt perceive thy heart to be more cloſely united to God every day than other, and wilt have ſuch a ſenſe of his Love continually upon thy Soul, as will make all the Changes of thy Life comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fill thee oftentimes with joy that can be compared to none but thoſe of the Saints in Heaven. The truth is, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more like to thoſe bleſſed Spirits, than when we are thus employed; for what do they but contemplate the Beauty of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and make Acts of Love to him? But here's
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48385:93"/>the difference, they ſee him clearly as he is, they behold his unveiled Face, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exerciſe their Love with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt forvors, and partake of the higheſt joyes; whereas we, beholding him only in the Glaſs of his Creatures, are much more cold in our Love, and therefore leſs happy in our joyes.</p>
               <p>I can foreſſe but one thing that thou can'ſt object againſt theſe exerciſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that they will be a hindrance to thy Worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. But this, one Word may ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; For theſe being works of the Soul, which is an active and moſt nimble ſubſtance, and not requiring the help of any Member of the Body, may be intermixed with all thy ordinary Employments; and if there be any of ſuch a nature, as will not admit them without ſome little ſtop, as requiring a full application of thy mind; yet that ſtop will be no hinderance, but rather a mighty furtherance to them; for whil'ſt thou do'ſt thus look up to God upon whom the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of every thing depends, thou wilt be able to proceed more cheerfully in thy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and with greater Vigour, through the confidence of his Bleſſing upon all that thou art a doing.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:48385:93"/>
               <p> But there is one Advice more, which ſhall conclude this part, and may ſupply all that is wanting in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Containing the laſt general Advice, To commit our Souls to the Care and Conduct of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guides; with proper Directions relating to it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>THat thou must commit thy Soul to the Care and Conduct of a ſpiritual Guide,</hi> for the enforcing of this Advice much might be ſaid, and indeed the little account that moſt men make of their ſpiritual Guides, in this Age, requires much to be ſaid; but becauſe I have ſet my ſelf but ſhort bounds, and becauſe I hope, that thou art well diſpoſed by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſes, to receive good Counſel, I ſhall be as brief as poſſibly I can with reſpect to thy Good. There are Three or Four things which are well known to Chriſtians, and I hope they will be readily acknowledged by thee for great truths, which being well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by thee, will let thee know both how neceſſary, and how beneficial this Advice will be to thee.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48385:94"/> 1. Thou wilt acknowledge, that Chriſt hath ſettled an Order of men, as his Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes upon earth, to take Care of Souls to the end of the World. This we find him doing immediately before his aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thus we read in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>chap.</hi> 21.18, 19, 20. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth, go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and teach (or diſciple) all nations, baptize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them te obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you, and lo I am with you alwaies even to the End of the World.</hi> And thus we read in the 16. <hi>c.</hi> of St. <hi>Marc. v.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the World and preach the Goſpel to every Creature: He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And thus in the 21. <hi>c.</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>v.</hi> 21.22, 23. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you; and when he had ſaid this, he breathed on them, and ſaith, receive ye the Holy Ghoſt whoſevers Sins ye remit, they are remitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and whoſoevers ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> That our bleſſed Saviour ſaid all this to his Diſciples, no Chriſtian can doubt and that, by theſe words he did commit that Power and Authority to them, which he had received from his Father, for the Good of mens Souls, is not to be denied, and if any
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48385:94"/>Queſtion be made, whether this concerned the Apoſtles only, and was confined by him to their own perſons; it may clearly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by conſidering, 1. The importance of thoſe words, <hi>I am with you alwayes even to the End of the World;</hi> for how could he be with them to the End of the World, if we ſuppoſe thoſe words to concern their perſons only? they might be with him indeed, but he could not be with them to the End of the World, who were not to be, or to exerciſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given them to the End thereof. 2. By conſidering the neceſſities of the World: for what an unhappy condition would they be in, who were to live in ſucceeding Ages, if no proviſion were made for their Inſtruction in the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. By conſidering that the Apoſtles, after they had received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in an eminent and remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, according to Chriſt's promiſe, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Commiſſion otherwiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find, that they did by Prayer and Impoſition of hands, (the ordinary way of conferring offices among the <hi>Jews</hi>) confer the like Power upon others, as they ſaw good for the edification of the Church: and thoſe perſons, upon whom they conferred this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are charged by them <hi>to take heed to the flock, and to feed the Church of Chriſt, and are ſaid to be called and appointed thereunto by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48385:95"/>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 20.28. And further, thoſe perſons that were thus ordained by the Apoſtles, are charged by them to ordain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the ſame way, and directions are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, what manner of perſons they were to ordain to ſo great an office. Thus the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> having put <hi>Timothy</hi> in mind of <hi>that Sacred office to which he</hi> had been <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by impoſition of hands,</hi> 2 Epiſt. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6. and <hi>of that form of ſound words, which he had heard from him in Faith and Love</hi> v. 13. chargeshim to <hi>commit the ſame to faithful men, who might be able to teach others alſo,</hi> chap. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2. And the ſame Apoſtle tells <hi>Titus,</hi> to whoſe Care he had committed the whole Church of the Iſland of <hi>Creete, that he had left him there,</hi> and appointed him <hi>to ordain Elders,</hi> i.e. Biſhops and Presbyters <hi>in every City,</hi> chap. 1. v. 5. To theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>how they ſhould behave themſelves in the Church of God,</hi> as his expreſſions are 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> Not only as to the ordaining of others, but likewiſe in many other things relating to the edification of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. as to preaching, <hi>that they ſhould hold faſt that form of Doctrine which they had received, and teach that, and none other,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.14. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14.2. As to the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.3. As to Government and Diſcipline, the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48385:95"/>holding of Eccleſiaſtical Courts, the receiving of Accuſations, the conventing of the accuſed publikely, the correcting of heretical, and other diſorderly perſons, the ſtopping of their Mouths, and the Excommunicating them or caſting them out of the Church, <hi>charging them to prejudge no man's</hi> Cauſe, and <hi>to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Favour or partiality</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>v.</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And ſo likewiſe as to the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of Penitents, and reſtoring them into the Communion of the Church, and the hopes of Pardon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>v.</hi> By all which it appears plainly, that Chriſt did not commit the Care of thoſe Souls, which He had redeemed with his moſt precious blood, to thoſe only, who were in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner called his Apoſtles, in the words before ſet down, but that he did there ſettle an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men, and give Authority to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a perpetual ſucceſſion, to watch over them, and to ſee that none of them periſh, or fall ſhort of that Happineſs, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for them. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou muſt acknowledge likewiſe that this Order of men, thus ſettled by Chriſt to take Care of Souls, are authorized and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by him to preach the Goſpel, to make known the Love of God, as manifeſted

This thou wilt plainly ſee if thou wilt conſider, beſides the places of Scripture already mentioned, the following Texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20, 21, 26, 27, 31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>v.

               <p n="3">3. Thou muſt acknowledge, that Chriſt hath promiſed <hi>to be with thoſe his Officers,</hi> and <hi>ministers,</hi> and accordingly he hath, is, and will be with them in the Exerciſe of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of their office <hi>to the end of the World, i.e.</hi> He will aſſiſt them with ſpecial
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48385:96"/>Illumination, Direction, and Power, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, and the edification of the Church, and according to the neceſſities and capacities of the Times wherein they are to live: he will furniſh them with all neceſſary and requiſite Gifts, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their Endeavours with his Holy Spirit, to make them eſſectual; will hear their Prayers, confirm their Cenſures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This we are plainly taught in ſeveral places of Scripture, beſides thoſe already pointed to. See <hi>John</hi> 14.16, and 26. Where Chriſt promiſes his Apoſtles <hi>a Comforter to be with them for ever, and to teach them all things.</hi> And ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> Where the Apoſtles ſpeaking of the ſeveral Officers that Chriſt hath appointed in his Church, and of the Gifts and Graces which he doth furniſh them withal, does intimate that theſe ſhall be continued in the Church, in ſuch a manner and meaſure as is neceſſary, <hi>till we all come</hi> (that is, both Jews and Gentiles) <hi>into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the Statute of the fulneſs of Chriſt, i.e.</hi> to ſuch prefection in Knowledge, Wiſdome and Good-ueſs, as that there will be no further Danger <hi>of being like Childrent oſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> v. 13, 14.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou muſt acknowledge likewiſe, That, as Chriſt hath appointed an Order of men, thus to guide and govern his Church, and hath charged them to attend unto it with all their Might, upon pain of anſwering for thoſe Souls that ſhall periſh through their Neglect or Default, [See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.8, 9, 10.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48385:97"/>and <hi>Act.</hi> 20.26, 27.] ſo he hath charged all men to reſpect them as his Officers, as the Guides and Governours of their Souls on Earth under him, and to ſubmit themſelves to their Conduct and Government, in all things relating to the Salvation of thier Souls: and this upon Pain of loſing all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, Advantages, and Benefits, which they can hope for, or pretend to upon the account of what he hath done, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us. Of this, thou wilt ſee no Reaſon to doubt, if thou wilt conſider, that this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proviſion which Chriſt hath made for mens Souls in appointing theſe Guides and Governours, and vouchſafing them all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary aſſiſtances for the diſcharge of their office, will ſignify very little, in caſe men be at liberty to ſubmit to them or not, and may be ſaved though refuſing to ſubmit to them. But beſides this, (to give thee all the ſatisfaction that may be in a matter which many are very unwilling to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) thou may'ſt conſider ſome few places of Scripture, which do plainly inform us of the Mind of Chriſt concerning it: [I omit what may be ſaid out of the Old Teſtament, and from the Prieſtly Power and Office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, (as I have done all along,) becauſe I deſign not a full diſcourſe upon thoſe things.] As God the Father was pleaſed tod eclare,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48385:98"/>That he had conſtituted his Son Chriſt Jeſus to be the ſupreme Guide and Governours of Souls, and to charge all men to hear and obey him, of which we have clear Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.17. and <hi>Math.</hi> 17.5. So Chriſt hath leſt to the World a clear Teſtimony, that he did commit the Authority which he had received from his Father, to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and their Succeſſors, [<hi>John</hi> 20, 21. <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi>] and that it is his Will, that all muſt hear and obey them, who will have any Intereſt in him, or Benefit by him; ſo in the places before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19, 20. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. Where, giving Commiſſion to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to preach the Goſpel to all Nations, and to receive thoſe that ſhould believe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Covenant of Grace, which he had ſealed with his blood, by Baptiſm, he tells them: <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> i.e. thoſe that do heartily believe that Goſpel, which you preach, and do profeſs ſo to do, and do engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be my Diſciples, and to obey my Commands by receiving Baptiſm at your hands, and do continue to learn from you what I have commanded, [compae theſe words with thoſe in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>] and practiſe accordingly in the whole Courſe of their
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48385:98"/>Lives, ſhall be ſaved; but thoſe that refuſe to do this, ſhall be damned; to which words if we joyn thoſe, which he ſpake ſome time before to his Diſciples, when he ſent them to preach to Goſpel to the loſt Sheep of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Luke</hi> 10.16. We ſhall underſtand his Mind more clearly. <hi>He that heareth you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>heareth me; and he that deſpilſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> Where we ſee, that as he hath given that Authority, which he had received from his Father, to theſe his Miniſters, ſo he doth require all men to own it, and ſubmit unto it; and that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Diſowning, the Not obeying, the Rejecting and Deſpiſing them in the Exerciſe of it, as the Diſowning, Rejecting and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing of himſelf, and his Authority; and his Father likewiſe will judge it to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and Deſpiſing him, and his Sovereign Power and Authority. But this is not all that the Holy Scriptures ſpeak concerning this matter; it was foreſeen by God, how hardly the generality of men would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of theſe things, and therefore the Holy Spirit ſtirred up the bleſſed Apoſtles, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to put men in mind of the Authority of Chriſt's Miniſters, and the Duty that we owe unto them. Thus we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Corinthians, That they are the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48385:99"/>of Chriſt, and Stewards of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of God, and charging them to esteem them as ſuch,</hi> 1 Corinth. 4.1. <hi>v.</hi> and we find him beſeeching the <hi>Theſſalonians to know them that did labour among them, and were over them in the Lord, and did admoniſh them; and to esteem them very highly in Love for their work ſake,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.12, 13. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> charges them, <hi>to obey them that had the Rule over them,</hi> [or their Guides, or Leaders, ſo the word ſignifies] <hi>and to ſubmit themſelves;</hi> and he backs his Charge with this Reaſon, <hi>That they did watch for their Souls, is thoſe that were to give account,</hi> i.e. they are appointed by Chriſt to watch for mens Souls, and they muſt give Account to him of the Souls committed to their Charge: and this they can never be able to do with any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if they will not obey and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them: and this, (he tells them) <hi>viz.</hi> their making their Account ſad and grievous by their Non-Submiſſion, <hi>would be unprofitable for them.</hi> He means more than his words expreſs, according to a way of Speaking very uſual in the Scriptures, <hi>i.e.</hi> this will be ſo far from being profitable for them men, that it will bring the greateſt Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and miſchief to them, <hi>viz,</hi> the Ruine and perdition of their Souls. I forbear to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48385:99"/>mention any more places of Scripture, and I omit to urge the Practice of the firſt and beſt chriſtians, as alſo the black Characters that are given by ſome of the Holy Writers, of thoſe that did ſlight the Guides and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church, and refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves unto them; becauſe I have promiſed not to be tedious.</p>
               <p>Now having carefully obſerved, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly weighed theſe things, give me leave to put ſome few Queſtions briefly to thee. Do'ſt thou believe that there is no need of theſe Spiritual Guides in the World? if there be no need of them, why did Chriſt appoint them? why did He not leave men to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Concerns of their Souls, as he hath done in thoſe things that concern their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their outward Eſtates? For, That he hath not appointed any Order of Men, to teach men how to provide for their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or to encreaſe their Eſtates, is confeſt by all. Was there need of theſe Guides for the firſt preaching of Chriſtianity to the World, and is there no need of them for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and maintenance of it in the World? I forbear to preſs thee with the Natural Blindneſs of mens Underſtandings, with that Inconſideration, Raſhneſs, Levity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, which is inſeparable tof Humane Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> alſo with that Averſeneſs to the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48385:100"/>things of God, and the great Intereſts of our Souls, which all men feel, and good men cannot but complain of: We may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That if Chriſt had not known, that the World needed ſpiritual Guides, He would never have appointed any ſuch, nor have promiſed them thoſe Aſſiſtances, which thou haſt now heard of, nor have taken any Care to inform men of the Duty they do owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and therefore are not thoſe men too much puft up in their fleſhly Minds, or too regardleſs of their Everlaſting Intereſts, that account theſe Guides to be of no Uſe to them; or are wanting in that Reſpect for them, and dependance upon them which they ought to have? I doubt not, but thou wilt confeſs it. But further, do'ſt thou not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by what hath been ſaid, that men may receive very great Advantages by their ſpiritual Guides, if they pleaſe themſelves? Surely, thoſe of old, that received them as the <hi>Galatians</hi> did, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.14. as <hi>the Angels</hi> of God, yea, even <hi>as Christ Jeſus,</hi> did believe ſo. Beſides, was not the making of this Proviſion for the Good of mens Souls, a great demonſtration of Chriſt's Love and Care for them? and therefore muſt not they be great deſpiſers of the Love of Chriſt, and Enemies to their own Souls, that make little Account of it, and ſeek no Advantage
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48385:100"/>by it? or can they with the leaſt ſhadow of Reaſon call themſelves Chriſtians, or expect to be Partakers of thoſe Benefits which he hath promiſed to his faithful Servants, who have no Regard at all to his Ordinances and Inſtitutions, or no other Regard to them, than as they pleaſe their own Humors, and are agreeable to their Stubborn Wills? I doubt not but thou wilt anſwer to theſe Demands according to my hearts Deſire, and therefore thou can'ſt not but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that my Advice is good and uſeful: That thou commit thy Soul to the Care and Conduct of a Spiritual Guide. I proceed now to ſhew thee briefly, how thou muſt practiſe this Advice.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>The Practice of the former Advice.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Thou muſt make Choice of a good Guide. I call him a good Guide, who having Authority from Chriſt, is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee aright in all the Concerns of thy Soul; and will be faithful to thee. Chriſt hath no where promiſed, that none ſhall take upon them to be Guides of Souls, but thoſe that have Authority from him: nor that all thoſe that have Authority from him ſhall diſcharge their Office faithfully. Among his Twelve Apoſtles there was a <hi>Judas,</hi> and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48385:101"/>among the Seven Deacons ordained by the Apoſtles, Tradition tells us, there was one that failed: and in thoſe Writings that we have of ſome of the Apoſtles, we find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of ſome, that loved the World more than Chriſt, and their own fleſhly Luſts more than the Good of Souls; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath told us, that, <hi>as there were of old, falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among God's people, ſo there ſhall be falſe Teachers among Chriſtians, who through Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ſhall with feigned words make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1, 2, 3. And therefore it is no matter of Wonder, if there be ſome ſuch among us now; but it ought to be matter of Caution to thee, with whom thou do'ſt truſt thy Soul. Thy Soul is a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of too great Value to be put into the hands of every Pretender, yea, or of every one whoſe office it is to take Care of Souls. And thoſe that are ready to follow the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Counſel of every one, that will take upon him to be their Guide or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, are not much leſs to be blamed, than thoſe that will commit their Souls to none; and therefore, thou art to take the greateſt Care, and to uſe the beſt Skill thou haſt, in the choice of thy Guide; and becauſe it is a matter of no little difficulty to make a right Choice, it will not, I hope, be thought imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to give thee ſome aſſiſtance. And</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:48385:101"/> 1. I adviſe thee to betake thy ſelf to thy Cloſet, and to beg of God to direct thee in thy Choice. Though thou haſt ever ſo much Skill in judging of men, yet it is poſſible that in this Caſe thou may'ſt be deceived; and the more thou truſteſt to thy own Skill, the greater danger thou art in of being deceived, God uſually ſuffering thoſe that have a great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themſelves, to miſearry in their beſt Undertakings: and therefore in this, as well as in other things, thy ſecurity lies in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confidence in God's direction, which thou art to beg of him by fervent Prayer; and though the Bleſſing be great, yet thou haſt no Reaſon to doubt but thou ſhalt obtain it, if thou do'ſt ask aright; for ſince he hath done ſo much for thy Soul already, He will not deny thee any thing, thou may'ſt be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he knows to be neceſſary for its Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Happineſs. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdome</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>let him ask of God, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it ſhall be given him,</hi> chap. 1. v. 5. And what greater Wiſdome can'ſt thou deſire, than that which may enable thee to chuſe to good Guide; except it be that which may enable thee to follow him, when thou haſt made Choice of him? which thou art alſo to ask to God. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:48385:102"/> 2. Though thou muſt not confide in thy own Skill, but in the Aſſiſtance and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Almighty God; yet, ſince his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Direction can be expected only in a rational way, it will behove thee to make Uſe of that Skill which God giveth thee; and that, with as much Care, as if thy Succeſs depended altogether upon it. This, in other matters, thou thinkeſt thy ſelf bound to do; and I can ſee no Reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt not be of the ſame Mind in this Caſe. Thou muſt therefore look out into the World, and conſider, who among thoſe Guides of Souls that are known to thee, is moſt fit to be truſted; and if thou do'ſt deſire the opinion of ſome ſerious and diſcreet Friends, as thou art wont to do when thou needeſt a Phyſitian for thy Body, or a Lawyer for ſettling thy Eſtate; I think thou wilt do very well: only let me cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, That thou do not preſume to make Judgment of any one, with whom thou art not throughly acquainted; for otherwiſe, though it is poſſible thou may'ſt hit right, yet it is two to one, that thou wilt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; which will be a fault that will admit of no Excuſe. And the ſame caution thou art to take in receiving the judgments of others: which thou wilt not think to be needleſs, if thou do'ſt conſider, That as ſome few have a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48385:102"/>better Repute in the World, than they do deſerve, ſo others have a worſe; and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerved, that many excellent men have ſuffered very much from many, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they have given Credit to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of thoſe who were never intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, and yet have preſumed to paſs their Cenſures on them. But to help thee as much as I can in this matter, which is really of very greato Importance to thee, it will not be amiſs to give thee a ſhort Account of the Qualifications and Properties of a good Guide, referring thee for further Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A good Guide is one that hath received Authority from Chriſt, to take Care of Souls; not immediately from Chriſt, but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, <hi>i.e.</hi> by impoſition of hands from ſome Biſhop of the Church, who in a conſtant Succeſſion from the Apoſtles of our Lord, had Authority to give it. As for thoſe that pretend to derive Authority immediately from Chriſt, thou muſt look upon them as Impoſtors, till they can ſhew thoſe Teſtimonials of their Authority, which the Apoſtles did, <hi>viz.</hi> the Gifts of Tongues, and Miracles; and if their Learning and ſeeming Piety ſhould chance to incline thee to believe otherwiſe of them, it behoves thee to cal to Mind that Caution
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48385:103"/>which Chriſt hath given thee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets; which come to you in Sheeps-Cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves.</hi> And as for thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Authority derived by the hands of ſome of the Inferiour Miniſters in the Church, which are now, and have been for many hundred years called Presbyters, and by that name diſtinguiſhed from Biſhops; thou may'ſt upon the ſame grounds on which thou haſt received thy Chriſtianity, believe them to pretend to that which they have not; for it is certain by unqueſtionable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that for above fifteen hundred years, there was no ſuch Authority allowed, or acknowledged in Presbyters, by the Church of Chriſt: and as for thoſe in this laſt Age that did firſt pretend to this Authority, and did take upon them to confer it upon others by impoſition of their hands, it is certain that all the Authority they had, or could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, they received from Biſhops, which was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Authority to preach the Word, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, according to the Rules of the Goſpel &amp; the Canons of the Church, and this in Subordination to their Biſhops; and not an Authority to ordain others in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their Biſhops; and therefore if it be true, That none can give that which they have not to give, and that none can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48385:103"/>to have received that which was never given them, as certainly it is; thou haſt great reaſon to believe that thoſe perſons, whom I now ſpeak of, have no Authority from Chriſt to take care of Souls. And then, in the laſt place, for thoſe that call themſelves the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, and pretend to have been ſo by the declared Conſent of a ſmall number of people combined together under the name of a Church; thou mayeſt believe them to be what they call themſelves, when they can prove, That the Apoſtles of our Lord were the peoples Miniſters, and not Chriſt's; I mean, That they did receive their Authority from the People, and not from Chriſt. Now if theſe men have no Authority from Chriſt, they have no Promiſe of Chriſt's preſence, aſſiſtance and Bleſſing in thoſe Exerciſes they take upon them to perform in his Name; and if they have no Promiſe of Chriſt's Preſence or Bleſſing, thou haſt no Reaſon to give up thy ſelf to their Conduct. Thou may'ſt perhaps hear them ſpeak many good things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their followers, and make great Boaſt of the Spirit of Chriſt; but when thou haſt impartially conſidered, the Hereſies, Schiſms, Seditions, Tumults, Rebellions, Murders, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, Perjuries, which they have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Promoters of, thou wilt know how to judge of their great Boaſts, and Godly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48385:104"/>By theſe their truits thou may'ſt know them. I ſay no more, nor indeed ſhould I have ſaid ſo much, but that the Diſorders of the Age do make it neceſſary to give thee ſome little Caution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A good Guide is a man of Knowledge. He is able to teach thee as much as thou art bound to believe and Practiſe: his lips preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and his tongue can ſhew thee right things. He cannot be a good Guide to others, that has need of a Guide himſelf. <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the Ditch,</hi> Matth. 15.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is a man of prudence, and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which appears both by his converſation, and in the Exerciſe of his Miniſtry, fitting his inſtructions to the Neceſſities, and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his people; <hi>He poures not new wine into old Bottles;</hi> He feeds not Children with ſtrong meat, and ſtrong men with milk: He provides for every one what is fitting for him, and that in due Seaſon. Indiſcretion does oftentimes as much miſchief, as the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ignorance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is humble, meek, and peaceable. So was the great Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls: He was no Lordly, domineering perſon; no breaker of the Peace of the World, or Overturner of Governments: but was a Servant unto all, even to the meaneſt of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48385:104"/>the people: he pleaſed not himſelf, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their Good, and ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf patiently and quietly to the Authority of the Chief Prieſts, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is very grave and ſerious; not out of Soureneſs or Sullenneſs of Humor, but from a real ſenſe of the Sacredneſs of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Worth of Souls, and the Account he muſt give of them. It is ſaid of a devout man, that when ſome deſired him to give them a certain Mark, by which they might know a man to be truly Spiritual, <q>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them in this manner, if ye ſee any one that takes delight in the common Sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Jeſtings, the Ralleries and Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of the World, that cannot patiently ſuffer Contempt and Reproach, take heed that you believe not that man to be, Spiritual though you ſhould ſee him work miracles.</q> This good man was undoubtedly in the right, and I think lie had not been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken if he had omitted the latter part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Not ſuffering Contempt, and given the affectation of Wit and Drollery for a ſufficient Mark of a very imperfect Chriſtian; however, it may ſerve for a Mark to diſcover a bad Guide: for if every Chriſtian ſhould be a ſerious perſono, (becauſe Chriſt was ſo) the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt ſhould be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48385:105"/>much more ſo; their Deportment ſhould be ſuch as may awe the men they do converſe with, and in a ſilent way deter them from their Sins; and their perſons ſhould ſpeak what the Statue of <hi>Senacherib</hi> is ſaid to have done. <hi>He who looketh to me, let him be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</hi> But though a good Guide be thus grave and ſerious, yet he is not Crabbed, Moroſe, or Cynical; but,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Affable and Courteous, and of Sweet and Winning Converſation; he diſdains not to converſe with the meaneſt People, and that freely and cheerfully too; nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf to all the innocent Cuſtomes of the World, ſo far as conſiſts with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of his Office, and the <hi>Decorum</hi> of his Perſon; having a due Reſpect to thoſe, he becomes all things to all men, and though his Gravity ſhews him to be an Enemy to their Sins, yet his innocent and cheerful Complyances, ſhew him to be a Lover of their Perſons. There was never any perſon more remarkable for this, than our bleſſed Saviour, who though his gravity was ſuch, that he was never ſeen to laugh, as we know of, yet was he of ſo ſweet and benign a Temper, and ſo courteous and complyant in all his Carriage and Converſation, that none were ever offended at it; &amp; to his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple does every good Guide of Souls conform
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48385:105"/>himſelf in this as well as in other things.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He is a man of Courage, he fears not the Faces of the greateſt perſons upon Earth, nor is diſcouraged in the doing of his Duty, by the Thoughts of their diſpleaſure. He is another <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> in this Reſpect, who was not afraid to tell the Tyrant <hi>Herod, That it was not lawful for him to have his Brother's Wife,</hi> Mar. 16.18. And like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he can be contented, if God will have it ſo, <hi>not only to be bound, but to dye for the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Act. 21.13.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He is wholly devoted to the Work that Chriſt hath appointed him to do; it is his only Buſineſs, and ſole Care; and as Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, that it was his Meat and Drink to do the Will of his Father, ſo 'tis his, to do the Will of Chriſt, in taking Care for Souls. he is no Plodder for the World, no Seeker of the Fleece, no Hunter after preferment; theſe Worldly things are as Droſs and Dung to him, and he will not ſell poor Souls for ſuch Gains.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. He is a great Lover of Souls, and of much tenderneſs and Compaſſion towards them; he will do any thing, yea, ſuffer any thing for their Good, and lay down his Life (if need be) for their ſakes; he is grieved for their miſcarriages more than for all worldly things, as <hi>Chriſt was grieved for the hardneſs
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48385:106"/>of</hi> men <hi>hearts,</hi> and is better pleaſed with their well doing, than by the greateſt earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proſperity; they are his joy and Crown that do well by his Miniſtry: he thinks no Honour greater, and knows no greater joy.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, He is a man of a Holy Life; his Example teaches us as much as his tongue, and he is a pattern for his People to walk by. <hi>His Converſation is in Heaven,</hi> and he can boldly call upon men to <hi>be Followers of him, and to walk as they have him for an Example.</hi> Though he is not without his Failings and Imperfections, as he is Fleſh and Blood, yet no Crimes, or groſs Sins, nor any Indulge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Allowing of himſelf in the leaſt, can the ſharpeſt and moſt malicious Eye behold in him. Thus have I given thee a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Qualifications of a good Guide. Such a Guide thou may'ſt boldly commit thy Soul to, and if thou wilt follow his Directions, he will keep thee, through the Grace of God, from all things hurtful, and lead thee into all things profitable for thy Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But there is one thing. That I am concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this place to mind thee of, <hi>viz.</hi> That, if the Curate of the Pariſh wherein thou liveſt, be thus qualified, thou haſt a Guide provided for thee, and thou muſt ſeek no further; for, he hath the Charge of thy Soul commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by God, and he muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48385:106"/>of it to God, which becauſe he cannot do if another have the Conduct of thy Soul, thou muſt not upon any pretence reſuſe his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and ſubmit to another's; beſides, in this Caſe thou can'ſt not reaſonably expect the Bleſſing of God, under the Conduct of another; becauſe, to pleaſe thy ſelf thou do'ſt act clean contrary to the Ordinance of God, and preferreſt thy own Wiſdome, before the Wiſdome of his Providence; beſides, thou can'ſt not hope to fall under the Conduct of a good Guide, if thou do'ſt reject him, who by the Appointment of God ought to have the Conduct of thee, becauſe no honeſt and prudent Guide will allow of this Practice, or take the Care of any upon him that belong to another Pariſh: except it be when the Pariſh is ſo unhappy, as to be under the Conduct of one, that is either grosſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or notoriouſly vicious. What I have ſaid therefore of looking out for a Guide; thou muſt underſtand as meant only, when the Pariſh to which thou do'ſt belong, is in this unhappy condition. In this Caſe, (though thou art bound to attend. to the publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his miniſtry, except thou art licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him or the Governours of the Church to do otherwiſe, and receiveſt much Benefit by it) thou art to follow, the Directions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given; but in no other. But to proceed,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48385:107"/> 2. In the ſecond place. Being reſolved as to the perſon thou deſigneſt for thy Guide, I adviſe thee to go to him; and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of thy Deſire to ſave thy Soul, and to put thy ſelf under his Conduct in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it; beſeech him to receive thee into his Care, and to give thee ſuch Directions as he ſhall think neceſſary and fitting for thee; aſſuring him, that thou wilt follow them to the utmoſt of thy Power, and endeavour to ſhew thy ſelf a good Chriſtian in ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thing thy ſelf to him, as to Chriſt's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and by depending altogether upon him. And that he may the better judge of the Honeſty and ſincerity of thy Heart in what thou telleſt him, and know what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections thou haſt moſt need of; be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to make thy ſelf fully known to him; tell him what manner of Education thou haſt had, what manner of Life thou haſt lead, what Convictions thou haſt had at any time of the evil of Sin, what Reſolutions thou haſt taken upon thoſe Convictions, how far thou haſT made them good, and wherein thou haſt failed: acquaint him with thy natural Temper, and thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Inclinations: tell him, what evil Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits thou haſt contracted, what vicious Cuſtomes thou haſt been, or art engaged in, what Temptations thou haſt found thy ſelf
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48385:107"/>moſt obnoxious to, and overcome by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, I adviſe thee to open thy very Soul unto him [he will help thee to do it by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and fitting Queſtions, if he find thee willing] and conceal not the leaſt thing from him. Thou would'ſt not ſcruple to diſcover the State of thy Body to thy Phyſitian, when thou needeſt his help; why then ſhouldeſt thou be ſhy of acquainting thy Spiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitain with the State of thy Soul? Art thou more aſhamed of the Diſeaſes of thy Soul, than thou art of the Infirmity of thy Body? the greater Reaſon thou haſt to deſire their Cure, and in Order to it to make them known; will thy Phyſitian keep the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of thy Body ſecret? no leſs ſafe will the Secrets of thy Soul be in the Boſome of thy Spiritual Guide. Away then with that imprudent and unſeaſonable modeſty, which will not do thee the leaſt Good, but may be the Occaſion of thy Ruine. Hear what a Heathen man hath ſaid, and bluſh at the Folly of thoſe that call themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <q>Thou ſaieſt unto a vicious man, hide thy ſelf with thy Vices,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> endure thy peſtilent and dangerous Diſeaſe, conceal thy Envy and Superſtition as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paintings, and beware, that thou give not thy ſelf to ſuch as can inſtruct and heal thee. [this is the Advice of the Devil, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48385:108"/>his Inſtruments upon Earth] but the Ancients expoſed their ſick men to open View. That ſuch as paſſed by, and had been ſick of the ſame Diſeaſes, or had given Eaſe and Help thereunto, might ſignify ſo much unto the ſick man: and they affirmed that the Art it ſelf, improved by ſuch experience, to have been much bettered thereby and encreaſed: in like manner it may ſeem expedient to lay open the Sins of our Life, and the evil Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Mind, that it may be lawful for any man conſidering and beholding the ſame, to ſay, Art thou angry? take heed of this; Art thou vexed with jealouſy? do this; Art thou in Love? I my ſelf was ſo, but have repented; now, when ſome men hide their Vices, deny, and conceal them; what do they but faſten them more throughly and ſurely to themſelves?</q> Thus a Heathen, whoſe words I do make the greater Account of, becauſe of thoſe of St. <hi>James,</hi> chap. 5. v. 16. <hi>Confeſs your Faults one to another, and pray one for another;</hi> which, if we underſtand, as many are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do, of making known our Sins to our Chriſtian Brethren, that they may the better underſtand what Petitions to put up to God in our behalf, they agree exactly with the Heathens Advice, though it be grounded upon another Motive; but the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48385:108"/>truth is, the words are read in ſome Books thus; <hi>Confeſs your Faults therefore to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And ſo they plainly refer to the words before, concerning the Elders of the Church, and their Prayers for the ſick, and the Effect of thoſe Prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> the Recovery of the ſick, and the Pardon of their Sins: and they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not our making Confeſſion to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren; but, (as men (to uſe one of the Fathers words) do not lay open the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſes of their Bodies to all,<note place="margin">Baſil.</note> but to thoſe that are skilful in the Art of Healing) to the Presbyters of the Church, whoſe Office it is to miniſter to the Health of Souls both by their Prayers and Counſels; and though the words [one to another] ſeem to make againſt this Interpretation, and to imply a mutual Confeſſion to be made by Chriſtians to each other; yet, if the Uſe of the Phraſe in other places be conſidered, and particularly in that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. Epiſt. chap. 5.5. v. <hi>All of you be ſubject to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which muſt be underſtood according to the Reaſon of the matter there ſpoken of, not of a mutual ſubjection, but of a ſubjection of all to thoſe that are over them; they will be but of little weight againſt it; the whole Context &amp; matter ſpoken of here, directing us to this Interpretation, as well as in that of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But to let this paſs, it is enough
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48385:109"/>for my preſent Purpoſe, that it be granted to be expedient for men in order to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Welfare, to confeſs their Sins to their Chriſtian Brethren; and if it be ſo, I think it is not tob e denied, but it is more expedient for them, to confeſs to thoſe whoſe Office it is to pray for them, and to counſel them, and who have miniſterial Authority from Chriſt to pronounce the Pardon and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of true Penitents. But to proceed,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Having thus acquainted the Spiritual Guide with thy Deſires, and having fully opened thy ſelf unto him, ſet thy ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Inſtructions; hear him, as thou would'ſt hear Chriſt himſelf, whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he is, ſpeaking to thee; mark what he ſaies with the greateſt Care: if any thing fall from him, which thou do'ſt not fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, deſire him to explain his Meaning; if thou do'ſt diſtruſt thy Memory, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions being many, deſire him to repeat them: and when he hath made an End, give him, together with they Tanks, thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to follow his Directions, and ſo begging his Prayers, and his Bleſſing in the Name of Chriſt, take thy leave of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As ſoon as thou art gone from him, begin to recollect the good Advices thou haſt received, and to practiſe accordingly; and omit not the Doing of any thing he hath
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48385:109"/>adviſed thee to. If any thing he hath adviſed thee to, ſeem hard, or without Reaſon, yet reject it not, but conſider; That, though thou do'ſt not perceive the Reaſon why he hath laid ſuch things upon thee, yet he may have ſeen good Reaſon for it; thou do'ſt not know but it was to try the ſincerity of the profeſſion thou haſt made to him, and to know the better how to fit himſelf to thy neceſſities hereafter: or it may be, he might (in prudence) deſign that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not underſtand the Reaſon of Some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Advices, till thou feeleſt the good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of them, and the great Advantages they bring thee, to diſpoſe thee the more readily and cheerfully to follow him for the Future; for, finding great benefit in that, in which thou couldeſt foreſee none, as well as in that which did promiſe thee much, as thou can'ſt not but think thy ſelf happy in meeting with ſuch a Guide, in Reſpect of that which is paſt, ſo thou can'ſt not but be mightily encouraged by it, to give him the entire diſpoſal of thee for the time to come. Be careful then, to obſerve his Directions in every thing: remembring, that as a ſick man can receive no Benefit by the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian in the World, how well ſoever he has made him to underſtand his Diſeaſe, if he puts up his Preſcriptions in his Pocket, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48385:110"/>makes no further Uſe of them; ſo the Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy Guide (how good ſoever they may be in themſelves) will be of no Advantage to thee, if thou do'ſt not follow them: nay, let me add, (which thou art concerned to remember,) that thy Caſe will be much worſe than the Caſe of ſuch an imprudent perſon: for, though he is not like to be benefitted by the Preſcriptions of his Phyſitian, yet he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no hurt by his not uſing them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou wilt receive much Dammage by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting thoſe that have been given thee; for, beſides this, that all inſincere dealing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and trifling in holy things, if I may ſo ſpeak, does in it ſelf tend to harden the heart, and to make thee more regardleſs of the great Concerns of thy Soul; it will certainly provoke God to withdraw his Grace from thee, and to leave thee to fall into that Ruine and Deſtruction, which thou art but little afraid of, and takeſt no Care to avoid.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Return to thy Guide after ſome time, and give him an impartial account of the Uſe thou haſt made of his Inſtructions, and the Benefit thou haſt received by them; if thou haſt failed in any thing, confeſs it freely, and declare thy Reſolution to do better for the time to come; if thou can'ſt ſay that thou haſt failed in nothing give God Thanks, and ſay as the young man did to our bleſſed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48385:110"/>Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20. <hi>What lack I yet?</hi> And then receive his Directions, as thou did'ſt before, and take Care to practiſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Keep a conſtant Correſpeondence with him as long as thou liveſt; acquainting him from time to time, with the State, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thy Soul, with thy Progreſs in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Vertue, with thy Temptations and Diſcouragements, with thy Failings and Imperfections, with thy Doubts and Fears, with thy Joyes and Sorrows, and undertake not any thing of moment or Importance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Advice and Approbation; thou wilt quickly be ſenſible of ſuch Advantages by this Courſe, as will effectually encourage thee to proceed in it. I will not inſiſt upon that Peace and Satisfaction which thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly enjoy in thyown mind by it, as having not only the Approbation of thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in every thing thou do'ſt, but alſo the Approbation of one of Chriſt's Miniſters, who is better able to judge of thy Actions, and may be preſumed to judg more impartially than thy ſelf would do. It may ſuffice to mention ſome of thoſe ſervices he will be continually doing thee; he will inſtruct thee in what thou art ignorant of, and will either prevent or rectify thy Miſtakes; he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve thy Doubts, and remove thy Fears, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48385:111"/>caſe thee of thy Sorrows: he will reſtrain thee when thou art too zealous and forward, and quicken thee when thou art dull and ſlothful, and refreſh and cheer thee, when thou art a weary; he will reſtore thee when thou art fallen, and apply the Promiſes of the Goſpel to thee, and help thee to take Comfort in them; he will remove many Difficulties out of thy way, and arme thee againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſupport thee under tryals, and be both a Guide and a Guardian to thee in all the dangerous and troubleſome Paſſages of thy Life; in a word, he will make thee to underſtand thy Duty fully, to know what is neceſſary, and what is lawful, and what is expedient, and what is ſeaſonable; and help thee to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Falſhood, Reality and Appearance, Good and Evil; he will excite and ſtir up thy Will to embrace the one, and refuſe the other; he will moderate thy affections, and keep thy Paſſions in Order, and preſerve thee in an even, ſteady Courſe of well-doing, and at laſt deliver thee up in Peace and ſafety into the hands of the great Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be, thou wilt meet with ſome that will ask thee, What neceſſity is there for all this? Why may it not be enough
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48385:111"/>for Thy Salvation, which is enough for the Salvation of moſt men, who live and dye, and go to Heaven without all this Trouble, contenting themſelves to have a Miniſter in their Pariſh, to hear him preach, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament from his hands? without putting themſelves or him to ſo much trouble concerning their Souls; if They may be ſaved without all this ado, why may'ſt not Thou? it is not good to be ſingular, and they that teach men to be ſo, are not their Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To thoſe men, many things may be replied, but it may ſuffice to offer theſe few things to their conſideration; we do not take upon us to judge of the everlaſting State of any, we leave that to be manifeſted in that day, which ſhall bring to light the moſt hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things: we do not bind men to take this Courſe upon pain of everlaſting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but ſurely, every man is concerned to endeavour to ſave his own Soul; and, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beſt way to do this, be to do as the moſt do, or to do as I have adviſed thee, do thou judge. Look into thee World, and obſerve the dayly Miſcarriages of thoſe men, whoſe Practice thou are urged to approve and imitate; how many of them after many years going to Church and hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, have no more Underſtanding in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48385:112"/>the very Principles of their Religion, than they had when they were Children, and of whom we may ſay as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did of ſome, <hi>that they are ever learning, but never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth;</hi> 2. Tim. 3.7. How many are puft up with a great opinion of their own Knowledge, that know nothing as they ought to know, and will never know any thing, becauſe thoſe that ſhould and would inſtruct them cannot know their Ignorance till it is too late to give them Inſtructions? how many of them become a Prey to Seducers, and drink in damnable Doctrines, with as much eagerneſs, as they ſhould do the moſt ſaving Truths, meerly becauſe they take upon them to judge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and will not take Advice of thoſe whom God hath ſet over them to direct them? How many go groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Burthen of troubled Conſciences for many years, and it may be after all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſperate, and lay violent hands upon themſelves, becauſe they would not diſcover their Grief to a Spiritual Phyſitian, who might have poured Wine and Oyl into their Wounds, and have bound them up to their everlaſting Peace and Comfort? how many go on in an evil Courſe, who might be perſuaded to leave it, but for ſome Prejudices which they have entertained either againſt a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48385:112"/>good life in general, or ſome particular duties, or againſt ſome doctrine, which if received would work a Reformation in them; which Prejudices Chriſt's Miniſters cannot remove, becauſe they know them not. How many, in a word, that mean well, and make many good promiſes and reſolutions, are overcome by their Luſts, and the Temptations of the Devil and the world, meerly for want of particular Directions, as to thoſe Luſts, and thoſe Temptations? Theſe ſad Shipwracks, and many more which thou may'ſt dayly behold, may convince thee how dangerous it is to go in the common way, and how much ſafer it will be for thee to follow the Advice that I have given thee: and if men will not be perſuaded that it is their Duty to do thus, I am ſure they may ſee that it is ſo much their Intereſt, that they cannot deſpiſe it without deſpiſing their own Souls. And as for the Imputation of Singularity, which thou may'ſt be threatned with, it is but what the beſt of Chriſt's Diſciples have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone in all Ages, and no good Chriſtian will make any reckoning of it: Were we to pleaſe men, we ſhould have Reaſon to dread it, but ſince our Buſineſs is to pleaſe God, and to ſave our Souls, it is no matter what they either ſay or think of us. Suppoſe, my Brother, That Chriſt had ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48385:113"/>as much concerned for the health of our Bodies, or the Encreaſe of our Eſtates, as he hath done for the Salvation of our Souls; That he had appointed an Order of Men to teach us how to get money, or to preſerve our ſelves in health and ſtrength for many years; and had given them as ſtrict a Charge to take Care of it, and be diligent in it, and had promiſed them as great aſſiſtances to make them Cares and Endeavours effectual to theſe Ends, as he hath done to the appointed Guides of Souls; and that he had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all men as ſtrictly to reſpect them as his Officers appointed to theſe Purpoſes; to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Directions, and ſubmit themſelves in all things to them, as he has commanded men to ſubmit to their ſpiritual Guides. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this, I ſay, do'ſt thou think that men would behave themſelves in that manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe good Friends of their Bodies, as they do to the great Friends and Guides of their Souls? Would they content themſelves to hear them read once or twice a week a publick Lecture of Phyſick, or good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry? no, no; we ſhould ſee every man running to their Houſes, and deſiring pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Converſation with them: we ſhould hear one Saying, <hi>Sir,</hi> you take great Pains among us, and read very well and learnedly; but I am a poor ignorant man, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48385:113"/>but little, and remember leſs, and therefore I pray you to explain and repeat ſome of thoſe good things to me, which you ſpeak in publick. And, another we ſhould hear complaining, That he could receive no Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by all his Pains, becauſe his Diſcourſes were not proper for his Caſe, and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to conſider his particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and to give him Directions ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereunto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This we may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe men would do, from what we ſee them do now, when they need the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Phyſitians, and of the men of Skill in Worldly matters; and we may boldly ſay, that they would not ſpare (keeping ſtill to the former Suppoſition) to make loud Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes againſt the appointed Phyſitian, as being falſe to their Truſt, in Caſe they ſhould refuſe to hear them in private, and refer them to their Publick Lectures. Now let any man tell me, why men do not take the ſame Courſe for their Souls, which they would take for their Bodies and Eſtates? Will they ſay that their Souls have not ſo much need of the Help of Chriſt's Miniſters, as their Bodies have of the Help of Phyſitians; and that they know better how to ſecure their Spiritual, and Eternal Welfare, than they do their Temporals? This would betray more ſtupid Ignorance, or
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48385:114"/>deviliſh pride and Self-Conceit, than they will be willing to diſcover. Will they ſay that the Miniſters may underſtand the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar neceſſities of every perſon, and provide for them without their taking the Courſe preſcribed; and that they may ſuit their Publick Inſtructions, Exhortations and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to all mens Capacities, how different ſoever they are? This will be, to make them more than Prophets, to aſcribe a kind of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience to them, yea, and an Omnipotence too; to make their Sermons, as God is ſaid by ſome to have made the <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderneſs, agreeable to the Taſte of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one; which I ſuppoſe no man in his Wits will do. What then is the Reaſon of it? for my part, I can give no other than this, That either they are grosſly ignorant, and little better than Beaſts in Underſtanding, or meer Infidels under the Name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; or if they do in ſome ſort believe the Goſpel, yet their hearts are ſo engaged to the World, that they cannot have any ſerious and Conſtant Regard to their Immortal Souls.</p>
                  <p>But, to put an End to this matter, let the Cauſe of the Common Practice be good or bad, I am ſure the Effects of it are ſad, and lamentable; the great Decay of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Piety among us, the great Encreaſe of all manner of Wickedneſs, the Multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48385:114"/>of Errors, Schiſms, and Diviſions, hath no one more viſible Cauſe than this; and till men be convinced that they own a greater Reſpect to their Spiritual Guides, than their Practice carries in it, and will be perſuaded to follow the Advice I have now given them, I cannot hope to ſee any Stop put to theſe Evils. I beſeech thee therefore, my Brother, by all that is dear to thee, not to deſpiſe my Counſel. Defer not to make Choice of a Guide; and when thou haſt done, be not ſlack to deſire his Advice, nor backward to follow it; thou may'ſt be conſident of the Bleſſing of God in So doing: thy Guide is particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give thee the beſt Advice he can, and God is concerned to make it effectual for thy Good, ſince he hath particularly ordained it for that End.</p>
                  <p>To theſe Directions I might add many more, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That thou wilt do well to endear thy ſelf to thy Guide as much as thou can'ſt that he may take the greater Care of thee, and be more ardently deſirous of thy Salvation; to which Purpoſe thou may'ſt do well to ſhew thy Eſteem of him, by a reſpectful Carriage before others.<note place="margin">Mounſ. de Reale.</note> There was a great and good man once in the World, that would never take place of a Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48385:115"/>the people, the Dignity of the Office requiring, as he believed, and deſerving the higheſt reſpect; and if any one ſay, that he was not of our Church, I anſwer, the greater Reaſon have moſt of us to be aſhamd of our ſelves, who call our ſelves reformed, and do worſe. And further, thou may'ſt do well to contribute cheerfully, according to thy Ability, towards his maintenance, if the be not plentifully provided for. The <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Chriſtians are not backward to do this; as thou may'ſt perceive by their devoting all that they had, to the Service of Chriſt and his Church <hi>Act.</hi> 4.34, 35. and I wiſh I could not ſay, that the Sacrilege of many that call themſelves Chriſtians in this Age, did not make it in ſome ſort neceſſary for good Chriſtians to do the ſame now.</p>
                  <p>That thou muſt keep cloſe to they Guide as long as thou liveſt, and never change him, if God's Providence doth not conſtrain thee.</p>
                  <p>That in all thy Intercouſe with thy Guide, thou muſt look beyond him; <hi>viz.</hi> to thy God, whoſe Miniſter he is, and who guides and bleſſes thee by his Miniſtry, to whom thou muſt dayly addreſs thy ſelf by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a Bleſſing upon his Endeavours, and to whoſe Goodneſs and Mercy thou muſt day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribe all the Benefit thou do'ſt receive
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48385:115"/>by them. But I muſt forbear, having too far exceeded my Bounds already. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with the words of our dar Lord and Saviour. Now <hi>thou knoweſt theſe things, happy art thou if thou do'st them. John</hi> 13.17.</p>
